Conversely, strong chromatin marking is related to transcriptional and post-transcriptional stability, an association also observed in mammals.

Emerging evidence has demonstrated that TREM2 could suppress inflammatory response by repression of microglia-mediated cytokine production and secretion, which may prevent inflammation-induced bystander damage of neurons. Higher levels of TREM2 mRNA (p = 0.002) and protein (p < 0.001) were identified in AD patients which indicates that TREM2 might serve as a novel noninvasive biomarker for AD diagnosis.

It is highly related to bone morphogenetic protein-3 (BMP-3) and often referred to as BMP3b. The nucleotide sequence of GDF-10 encodes a predicted protein of 476 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 52,000. The GDF-10 polypeptide contains a potential signal sequence for secretion, a putative RXXR proteolytic processing site, and a carboxy-terminal domain with considerable homology to other known members of the TGF-beta superfamily. GDF10 is found primarily in murine uterus, adipose tissue, and brain and to a lesser extent in liver and spleen. In addition, GDF-10 mRNA was present in both neonatal and adult bone samples, with higher levels being detected in calvaria than in long bone. These results suggest that GDF10 may play multiple roles in regulating cell differentiation events, including those involved in skeletal morphogenesis.

        "SR calcium uptake is mediated by a Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA2), whose activity is reversibly regulated by phospholamban (PLN). Dephosphorylated PLN is an inhibitor of SERCA and phosphorylation of PLN relieves this inhibition. Phospholamban (PLN) is a small integral membrane protein, which binds and inhibits in a yet unknown fashion the Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Based on structural and dynamics data, a model in which PLN undergoes allosteric activation upon encountering SERCA has been proposed. The allosteric regulation of SERCA depends on the conformational equilibrium of PLN, whose cytoplasmic regulatory domain interconverts between three different states: a ground T state (helical and membrane associated), an excited R state (unfolded and membrane detached), and a B state (extended and enzyme-bound), which is noninhibitory. Phosphorylation of PLN shifts the populations toward the B state, increasing SERCA activity. Phospholamban (PLN) regulates cardiac contractility via its modulation of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) activity. Impairment of this regulatory process causes heart failure."

        "Each human has slightly different DNA sequences, called genetic variants, which make each of us unique. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide an important avenue for undertaking an agnostic evaluation of the association between common genetic variants and the risk of disease. Recent advances in our understanding of human genetic variation and the technology to measure such variation have made GWAS feasible. Over the past few years, a multitude of GWAS has identified and replicated many associated variants. These associations could reveal the molecular mechanisms altered in common complex diseases and result in the identification of novel drug targets.",
        "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are a type of genetic study that aims to identify genetic variations associated with particular diseases or traits. GWAS analyze the entire genome of large groups of people to identify common genetic variants that may be associated with a particular disease or trait. These studies have been successful in identifying thousands of genetic variants associated with various diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. GWAS can also provide insights into the underlying biological mechanisms of these diseases and help identify potential targets for drug development. However, it is important to note that GWAS only identify associations between genetic variants and diseases or traits and do not necessarily establish causality. Additionally, GWAS often require large sample sizes to achieve statistical significance and may not capture rare genetic variants that may also contribute to disease risk.",
        "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are a powerful research approach used to identify associations between genetic variants and human phenotypes, such as diseases or complex traits. By examining the entire genome, GWAS aim to detect common genetic variations that may contribute to an individual's risk of developing a particular condition. These studies have successfully mapped thousands of loci associated with complex traits, enriching our knowledge about the genetic basis of diseases and potentially leading to the identification of novel drug targets. However, the underlying mechanisms for many GWAS findings remain unclear, and they often explain only a limited amount of heritability. Despite these limitations, GWAS provide an important avenue for understanding human genetic variation and its impact on disease risk."
