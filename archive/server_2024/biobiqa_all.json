Under conditions of reduced neuronal activity (1 muM tetrodotoxin), we observed extension of glutamate receptor-dependent processes from dendritic spines of CA1 pyramidal cells to presynaptic boutons. The formation of these spine head protrusions is blocked by alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonists and by agents that reduce the release of glutamate from presynaptic terminals. Moreover, spine head protrusions form in response to exogenously applied glutamate, with clear directionality toward the glutamate electrode.

We examine this directly by correlating time-lapse two-photon microscopy of newly formed spines on CA1 pyramidal neurons in organotypic hippocampal slices with electron microscopy. Our results show that, whereas spines that are only a few hours old rarely form synapses, older spines, ranging from 15 to 19 h, consistently have ultrastructural hallmarks typical of synapses.

However, whether neighbouring synapses are involved in encoding similar memory and how task-specific cortical networks develop during learning remain elusive. Using transcranial two-photon microscopy, we followed apical dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the motor cortex while mice practised novel forelimb skills. Here we show that a third of new dendritic spines (postsynaptic structures of most excitatory synapses) formed during the acquisition phase of learning emerge in clusters, and that most such clusters are neighbouring spine pairs. These clustered new spines are more likely to persist throughout prolonged learning sessions, and even long after training stops, than non-clustered counterparts. Moreover, formation of new spine clusters requires repetition of the same motor task, and the emergence of succedent new spine(s) accompanies the strengthening of the first new spine in the cluster. We also show that under control conditions new spines appear to avoid existing stable spines, rather than being uniformly added along dendrites. However, succedent new spines in clusters overcome such a spatial constraint and form in close vicinity to neighbouring stable spines.

The rat INS-1 cell line has been used to gain insight in this area because it secretes insulin in response to glucose concentrations in the physiological range. However, the magnitude of the response is far less than that seen in freshly isolated rat islets. In the current study, we have stably transfected INS-1 cells with a plasmid containing the human proinsulin gene. After antibiotic selection and clonal expansion, 67% of the resultant clones were found to be poorly responsive to glucose in terms of insulin secretion (< or =2-fold stimulation by 15 mmol\/l compared with 3 mmol\/l glucose), 17% of the clones were moderately responsive (2- to 5-fold stimulation), and 16% were strongly responsive (5- to 13-fold stimulation). The differences in responsiveness could not be ascribed to differences in insulin content. Detailed analysis of one of the strongly responsive lines (832\/13) revealed that its potent response to glucose (average of 10-fold) was stable over 66 population doublings (approximately 7.5 months of tissue culture) with half-maximal stimulation at 6 mmol\/l glucose. Furthermore, in the presence of 15 mmol\/l glucose, insulin secretion was potentiated significantly by 100 pmol\/l isobutylmethylxanthine (320%), 1 mmol\/l oleate\/palmitate (77%), and 50 nmol\/l glucagon-like peptide 1 (60%), whereas carbachol had no effect. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was also potentiated by the sulfonylurea tolbutamide (threefold at 3 mmol\/l glucose and 50% at 15 mmol\/l glucose) and was abolished by diazoxide, which demonstrates the operation of the ATP-sensitive K+ channel (K(ATP)) in 832\/13 cells. Moreover, when the K(ATP) channel was bypassed by incubation of cells in depolarizing K+ (35 mmol\/l), insulin secretion was more effectively stimulated by glucose in 832\/13 cells than in parental INS-1 cells, which demonstrates the presence of a K(ATP) channel-independent pathway of glucose sensing. We conclude that clonal selection of INS-1 cells allows isolation of cell lines that exhibit markedly enhanced and stable responsiveness to glucose and several of its known potentiators.

This study investigated if one could use a correlation between telomere length and age, to predict the age of an individual from their DNA. Telomere length, in buccal cells, of 167 individuals aged between 1 and 96 years old was measured using real-time quantitative PCR. Telomere length decreased with age (r=-0.185, P<0.05) and the age of an individual could be roughly determined by the following formula: (age=relative telomere length -1.5\/-0.005). The regression (R(2)) value between telomere length and age was approximately 0.04, which is too low to be use for forensics. The causes for the presence of large variation in telomere lengths in the population were further investigated. The age prediction accuracies were low even after dividing samples into non-related Caucasians, males and females (5%, 9% and 1%, respectively). Mean telomere lengths of eight age groups representing each decade of life showed non-linear decrease in telomere length with age. There were variations in telomere lengths even among similarly aged individuals aged 26 years old (n=10) and age 54 years old (n=9).

Construction of gland complementary-DNA libraries and phylogenetic analysis of transcripts revealed that nine toxin types are shared between lizards and snakes.

Mutations and epimutations in imprinted genes can give rise to genetic and epigenetic phenotypes, respectively; uniparental disomy and imprinting defects represent epigenetic disease phenotypes. There are also genetic disorders that affect chromatin structure and remodeling. These disorders can affect chromatin in trans or in cis, as well as expression of both imprinted and nonimprinted genes.

However, mechanistic insight into protein stabilization and prevention of protein aggregation by glycerol is still lacking. In this study, we derive mechanisms of glycerol-induced protein stabilization by combining the thermodynamic framework of preferential interactions with molecular-level insight into solvent-protein interactions gained from molecular simulations. Contrary to the common conception that preferential hydration of proteins in polyol\/water mixtures is determined by the molecular size of the polyol and the surface area of the protein, we present evidence that preferential hydration of proteins in glycerol\/water mixtures mainly originates from electrostatic interactions that induce orientations of glycerol molecules at the protein surface such that glycerol is further excluded. These interactions shift the native protein toward more compact conformations. Moreover, glycerol preferentially interacts with large patches of contiguous hydrophobicity where glycerol acts as an amphiphilic interface between the hydrophobic surface and the polar solvent. Accordingly, we propose that glycerol prevents protein aggregation by inhibiting protein unfolding and by stabilizing aggregation-prone intermediates through preferential interactions with hydrophobic surface regions that favor amphiphilic interface orientations of glycerol. These mechanisms agree well with experimental data available in the literature, and we discuss the extent to which these mechanisms apply to other cosolvents, including polyols, arginine, and urea.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19817484"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19817484"],"type":"not_usable","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":""}

After controlling for phylogeny using this procedure, the interpretation of many of the correlates changed. For instance, and contrary to previous studies, we found interspecific support for a neurophysiological role for rapid-eye-movement sleep, such as memory consolidation.

This defining feature of slow-wave sleep (SWS) apparently evolved independently in mammals and birds, as reptiles do not exhibit similar EEG activity during sleep. In mammals, the level of slow-wave activity (SWA) (low-frequency spectral power density) during SWS increases and decreases as a function of prior time spent awake and asleep, respectively, and therefore reflects homeostatically regulated sleep processes potentially tied to the function of SWS. Although birds also exhibit SWS, previous sleep deprivation studies in birds did not detect a compensatory increase in SWS-related SWA during recovery, as observed in similarly sleep-deprived mammals. This suggested that, unlike mammalian SWS, avian SWS is not homeostatically regulated, and therefore might serve a different function. However, we recently demonstrated that SWA during SWS increases in pigeons following short-term sleep deprivation. Herein we summarize research on avian sleep homeostasis, and cast our evidence for this phenomenon within the context of theories for the function of SWS in mammals. We propose that the convergent evolution of homeostatically regulated SWS in mammals and birds was directly linked to the convergent evolution of large, heavily interconnected brains capable of performing complex cognitive processes in each group. Specifically, as has been proposed for mammals, the interconnectivity that forms the basis of complex cognition in birds may also instantiate slow, synchronous network oscillations during SWS that in turn maintain interconnectivity and cognition at an optimal level.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18789355"},{"text":"The conservation of sleep across all animal species suggests that sleep serves a vital function.

Mammalian evolution, therefore, must involve mechanisms that tie increasing body and brain size to decreasing sleep requirements. Here I show that daily sleep requirement decreases across mammalian species and in rat postnatal development with a decreasing ratio between cortical neuronal density and surface area, which presumably causes sleep-inducing metabolites to accumulate more slowly in the parenchyma. Because addition of neurons to the non-primate cortex in mammalian evolution decreases this ratio, I propose that increasing numbers of cortical neurons led to decreased sleep requirement in evolution that allowed for more hours of feeding and increased body mass, which would then facilitate further increases in numbers of brain neurons through a larger caloric intake per hour. Coupling of increasing numbers of neurons to decreasing sleep requirement and increasing hours of feeding thus may have not only allowed but also driven the trend of increasing brain and body mass in mammalian evolution.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26400745"},{"text":"Despite decades of intense study, the functions of sleep are still shrouded in mystery.

TRPM5, which is distantly related to TRPM8, is a Ca2+-activated cation channel expressed in taste cells that is essential for sweet, bitter, and umami tastes.

{"body":"What effect has changing pH and salt concentration on protein complexes?","snippets":[{"text":"Proteins carry out the most difficult tasks in living cells. They do so by interacting specifically with other molecules. This requires that they fold to a unique, globular conformation that is only marginally more stable than the large ensemble of unfolded states. The folded state is stabilized mainly by the burial and tight packing of over 80% of the peptide groups and non-polar side chains. If life as we know it is to exist in a solvent other than water, the folded state must be stable and soluble in the new solvent. Our analysis suggests that proteins will be unstable in most polar solvents such as ethanol, extremely stable in non-polar solvents such as cyclohexane, and even more stable in a vacuum. Our solubility studies suggest that protein solubility will be markedly lower in polar solvents such as ethanol and that proteins will be essentially insoluble in non-polar solvents such as cyclohexane. For these and other reasons it seems unlikely that the life we know could exist in any solvent system other than water.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15306378"},{"text":"The goal of this review is to examine the effect of salts and organic additives on the solubility of proteins in aqueous mixed solvents.

The analysis showed a linear correlation between the preferential hydration parameter and the protein-cosolvent KB parameter. The same linear correlation holds even when nonelectrolyte cosolvents, such as polyethelene glycol, have been incorporated.

Recent time-resolved and thermodynamic studies of water molecules in salt solutions, however, demonstrate that bulk water structure is not central to the Hofmeister effect.

The most famous, and at the same time the most controversial, is the classification of cosolutes and ions as structure-breakers (chaotropes) or structure-makers (kosmotropes), and their identification as salting-in and salting-out agents, respectively. In this paper, we present results from molecular dynamics simulations correlating the ion-induced changes of the structural and dynamical properties of water and the ability of these ions to alter the magnitude of the hydrophobic interaction. Although most of the properties of water in the salt solutions change monotonically with the ability of the salt to increase\/decrease the hydrophobic interaction, none of them is able to predict the transition from salting-in to salting-out, a prediction that was observed by the preferential binding\/exclusion analysis. In addition, we find that the use of the terms, kosmotropes and chaotropes, is very misleading since the so-called kosmotropes can actually reduce the structure of water, whereas, the so-called chaotropes can increase the structure of water. Specifically, we find that the ability of the ions to reduce the hydrophobic interaction (a property attributed to chaotropes), correlates with their ability to increase the structure between the water molecules, including the number and strength of hydrogen bonds, and as a consequence, the water-water interaction energy (features attributed to kosmotropes). Nevertheless, the viscosity (as well as the rotational decay rate) of the water molecules decreases (increases) due to weaker binding to the ions. Thus, it is not the ion-induced structural ordering between the water molecules that affect the dynamical properties of water, but the strength of the ion-water interaction. Our results indicate that attempts to understand and predict salt-induced modulation of hydrophobic interactions only through the binary, salt-water, system is not possible.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19994836"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15306378","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16814736","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16821951","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17035073","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19994836"],"type":"factoid","exact_answer":"correlated with the preferential binding parameter","ideal_answer":"the aqueous protein solubility is correlated with the preferential binding parameter"}

Deletion of the Dnmt3L gene prevented the de novo methylation of both long-terminal-repeat (LTR) and non-LTR retrotransposons, which were transcribed at high levels in spermatogonia and spermatocytes. Loss of Dnmt3L from early germ cells also caused meiotic failure in spermatocytes, which do not express Dnmt3L. Whereas dispersed repeated sequences were demethylated in mutant germ cells, tandem repeats in pericentric regions were methylated normally.

As a result, we found that there was a significant fluctuation in the modifications; in spermatogonia, the stainings for H3K9ac, H3K18ac, and H3K23ac were strong while that for H3K4me3 was weak. In spermatocytes, the stainings for H3K9ac, H3K18ac, H3K23ac, and H3K4me3 were reduced in the preleptotene to pachytene stage, but in diplotene stage the stainings for H3K18ac, H3K23ac, and H3K4me3 seemed to become intense again. The staining for H3K27me3 was nearly constant throughout these stages. In the ensuing spermiogenesis, a dramatic acetylation and methylation of histone H3 was found in the early elongated spermatids and then almost all signals disappeared in the late elongated spermatids, in parallel with the replacement from histones to protamines. In addition, we confirmed that the staining of histone H3S10phos was exclusively associated with mitotic and meiotic cell division.

Signaling sequences and sites of posttranslational modifications are frequently, or very likely most often, located within regions of intrinsic disorder. Disorder-to-order transitions are coupled with the adoption of different structures with different partners. Also, the flexibility of intrinsic disorder helps different disordered regions to bind to a common binding site on a common partner. Such capacity for binding diversity plays important roles in both protein-protein interaction networks and likely also in gene regulation networks. Such disorder-based signaling is further modulated in multicellular eukaryotes by alternative splicing, for which such splicing events map to regions of disorder much more often than to regions of structure. Associating alternative splicing with disorder rather than structure alleviates theoretical and experimentally observed problems associated with the folding of different length, isomeric amino acid sequences. The combination of disorder and alternative splicing is proposed to provide a mechanism for easily \"trying out\" different signaling pathways, thereby providing the mechanism for generating signaling diversity and enabling the evolution of cell differentiation and multicellularity. Finally, several recent small molecules of interest as potential drugs have been shown to act by blocking protein-protein interactions based on intrinsic disorder of one of the partners.

The first demonstration of two-dimensional in vivo imaging of ultraweak photon emission from a rat's brain, using a highly sensitive photon counting apparatus, is reported in this paper. It was found that the emission intensity correlates with the electroencephalographic activity that was measured on the cortical surface and this intensity is associated with the cerebral blood flow and hyperoxia. To clarify the mechanism of photon emission, intensity changes from whole brain slices were examined under various conditions. The removal of glucose from the incubation medium suppressed the photon emission, and adding 50 mM potassium ions led to temporal enhancement of emission and subsequent depression. Rotenone (20 microM), an inhibitor of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, increased photon emission, indicating electron leakage from the respiratory chain. These results suggest that the photon emission from the brain slices originates from the energy metabolism of the inner mitochondrial respiratory chain through the production of reactive oxygen.

One explanation for this effect is that it results from a disturbance of competitive process which, during the first weeks of life, guides a \"sorting out\" of the initially intermixed right and left eye inputs into complementary, largely non-overlapping territories. One feature of this process may be a local interaction between right and left eye synapses in which like synapses reinforce each other's growth rates and cause rejection of the other eye's synapses. If this is the case, then the effect of monocular deprivation on the relative sizes of the two sets of columns can be explained by supposing that the strengths of the effects exerted by the deprived eye are reduced. This explanation has a testable consequence: if both eyes are deprived of vision then each eye should be made less effective in eliminating the other eye's inputs, and the overall rate at which the ocular dominance columns form should be decreased. Although LeVay et al. found that columns were present in a 7-week old monkey reared in the dark from the age of 3 days, this result does not necessarily imply that the rate of column formation had been normal, because in normal monkeys the columns are well developed by 3 or more weeks of age.

After the injection of d-amphetamine (1 and 2 mg\/kg i.p.) the enhancement of acetylcholine release was 110 and 210% in the hippocampus whereas it was 35 and 54%, respectively, in the caudate nucleus. As observed in the caudate nucleus, pretreatment with the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist, SCH 23390, antagonized the cocaine- and amphetamine-induced increase in hippocampal acetylcholine release. These results show that cocaine and d-amphetamine, by increasing dopaminergic transmission, enhance the extracellular concentrations of acetylcholine in both brain areas. The relative enhancement in the hippocampus was far greater than that in the caudate nucleus, suggesting that dopaminergic control of cholinergic function differs in these two brain areas.

During a 15-min exposure to amphetamine (50 microM) in the nucleus accumbens, acetylcholine increased to 33% above pre-infusion levels, became maximal at 15 min post-infusion (+41%) and gradually returned to baseline levels by 60 min post-amphetamine. Conversely, amphetamine (1 mM) administration caused a biphasic change in acetylcholine release with a trend toward a decrease (-14%) during exposure followed by a significant increase (+36%) at 30 min post-amphetamine that returned to baseline levels by 60 min after infusion. The increases observed during amphetamine (50 microM) exposure and during recovery from amphetamine (1 mM) were both blocked by co-administration with the D1 antagonist, SCH 23390 (10 microM), but not with the D2 antagonist, sulpiride (10 microM). Co-infusion of sulpiride eliminated the trend toward reduced acetylcholine release observed during 1 mM amphetamine whereas co-administration of SCH 23390 potentiated this decrease. A possible tonic D1 facilitation of nucleus accumbens acetylcholine release was indicated by the consistent reductions in acetylcholine release observed during infusion of SCH 23390.

Here we describe the structural changes in the proton-translocating F0 subunit c that are induced by deprotonating the specific aspartic acid involved in proton transport. Conformational changes between the protonated and deprotonated forms of subunit c provide the structural basis for an explicit mechanism to explain coupling of proton translocation by F0 to the rotation of subunits within the core of F1. Rotation of these subunits within F1 causes the catalytic conformational changes in the active sites of F1 that result in ATP synthesis.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10580496"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10580496"],"type":"factoid","exact_answer":"transmembrane proton gradient","ideal_answer":"F1F0 ATP synthases use a transmembrane proton gradient to drive the synthesis of cellular ATP"}

This chapter outlines a high-yielding procedure for preparation of solutions of intact mitotic chromosomes from root tips of young seedlings and for their analysis using flow cytometry and sorting. Root tips accumulated at metaphase are mildly fixed with formaldehyde, and solutions of intact chromosomes are prepared by mechanical homogenization. The advantages of the present approach include the use of seedlings, which are easy to handle, and the karyological stability of root meristems, which can be induced to high degree of metaphase synchrony. Chromosomes isolated according to this protocol have well-preserved morphology, withstand shearing forces during sorting, and their DNA is intact and suitable for a range of applications.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21181533"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21181533"],"type":"not_usable","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":""}

We demonstrate here that SA-beta-gal activity is expressed from GLB1, the gene encoding lysosomal beta-D-galactosidase, the activity of which is typically measured at acidic pH 4.5. Fibroblasts from patients with autosomal recessive G(M1)-gangliosidosis, which have defective lysosomal beta-galactosidase, did not express SA-beta-gal at late passages even though they underwent replicative senescence. In addition, late passage normal fibroblasts expressing small-hairpin interfering RNA that depleted GLB1 mRNA underwent senescence but failed to express SA-beta-gal. GLB1 mRNA depletion also prevented expression of SA-beta-gal activity in HeLa cervical carcinoma cells induced to enter a senescent state by repression of their endogenous human papillomavirus E7 oncogene. SA-beta-gal induction during senescence was due at least in part to increased expression of the lysosomal beta-galactosidase protein.

Twelve initially identical populations of Escherichia coli were founded in 1988 to investigate this issue. They have since evolved in a glucose-limited medium that also contains citrate, which E. coli cannot use as a carbon source under oxic conditions. No population evolved the capacity to exploit citrate for >30,000 generations, although each population tested billions of mutations. A citrate-using (Cit+) variant finally evolved in one population by 31,500 generations, causing an increase in population size and diversity. The long-delayed and unique evolution of this function might indicate the involvement of some extremely rare mutation. Alternately, it may involve an ordinary mutation, but one whose physical occurrence or phenotypic expression is contingent on prior mutations in that population. We tested these hypotheses in experiments that \"replayed\" evolution from different points in that population's history. We observed no Cit+ mutants among 8.4 x 10(12) ancestral cells, nor among 9 x 10(12) cells from 60 clones sampled in the first 15,000 generations. However, we observed a significantly greater tendency for later clones to evolve Cit+, indicating that some potentiating mutation arose by 20,000 generations. This potentiating change increased the mutation rate to Cit+ but did not cause generalized hypermutability. Thus, the evolution of this phenotype was contingent on the particular history of that population.

In this review, we summarize half a century of research and come to the disappointing realization that the column may have no function. Originally, it was described as a discrete structure, spanning the layers of the somatosensory cortex, which contains cells responsive to only a single modality, such as deep joint receptors or cutaneous receptors. Subsequently, examples of columns have been uncovered in numerous cortical areas, expanding the original concept to embrace a variety of different structures and principles. A \"column\" now refers to cells in any vertical cluster that share the same tuning for any given receptive field attribute. In striate cortex, for example, cells with the same eye preference are grouped into ocular dominance columns. Unaccountably, ocular dominance columns are present in some species, but not others. In principle, it should be possible to determine their function by searching for species differences in visual performance that correlate with their presence or absence. Unfortunately, this approach has been to no avail; no visual faculty has emerged that appears to require ocular dominance columns. Moreover, recent evidence has shown that the expression of ocular dominance columns can be highly variable among members of the same species, or even in different portions of the visual cortex in the same individual. These observations deal a fatal blow to the idea that ocular dominance columns serve a purpose. More broadly, the term \"column\" also denotes the periodic termination of anatomical projections within or between cortical areas. In many instances, periodic projections have a consistent relationship with some architectural feature, such as the cytochrome oxidase patches in V1 or the stripes in V2. These tissue compartments appear to divide cells with different receptive field properties into distinct processing streams. However, it is unclear what advantage, if any, is conveyed by this form of columnar segregation. Although the column is an attractive concept, it has failed as a unifying principle for understanding cortical function. Unravelling the organization of the cerebral cortex will require a painstaking description of the circuits, projections and response properties peculiar to cells in each of its various areas.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15937015"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15937015"],"type":"not_usable","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":""}

Approximately 1.7% of the genes represented on the array exhibited significant expression changes within the first 30 min of gravity stimulation. Among gravity-induced genes were a number of genes previously implicated to be involved in gravitropism. However, a much larger number of the identified genes have not been previously associated with gravitropism. Because reorientation of plants may also expose plants to mechanical perturbations, we also compared the effects of a gentle mechanical perturbation on mRNA levels during the gravity response. It was found that approximately 39% of apparently gravity-regulated genes were also regulated by the mechanical perturbation caused by plant reorientation. Our study revealed the induction of complex gene expression patterns as a consequence of gravitropic reorientation and points to an interplay between the gravitropic and mechanical responses and to the extreme sensitivity of plants to even very gentle mechanical perturbations.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12376639"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12376639"],"type":"not_usable","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":""}

By using this technique, growth, survival, and methane production of a newly isolated, hyperthermophilic methanogen Methanopyrus kandleri strain 116 are characterized under high temperatures and hydrostatic pressures. Elevated hydrostatic pressures extend the temperature maximum for possible cell proliferation from 116 degrees C at 0.4 MPa to 122 degrees C at 20 MPa, providing the potential for growth even at 122 degrees C under an in situ high pressure. In addition, piezophilic growth significantly affected stable carbon isotope fractionation of methanogenesis from CO(2). Under conventional growth conditions, the isotope fractionation of methanogenesis by M. kandleri strain 116 was similar to values (-34 per thousand to -27 per thousand) previously reported for other hydrogenotrophic methanogens. However, under high hydrostatic pressures, the isotope fractionation effect became much smaller (< -12 per thousand), and the kinetic isotope effect at 122 degrees C and 40 MPa was -9.4 per thousand, which is one of the smallest effects ever reported.

We hypothesized that there are differences among individuals in aptitude, propensity, and need for dancing that may partially be based on differences in common genetic polymorphisms. Identifying such differences may lead to an understanding of the neurobiological basis of one of mankind's most universal and appealing behavioral traits--dancing. In the current study, 85 current performing dancers and their parents were genotyped for the serotonin transporter (SLC6A4: promoter region HTTLPR and intron 2 VNTR) and the arginine vasopressin receptor 1a (AVPR1a: promoter microsatellites RS1 and RS3). We also genotyped 91 competitive athletes and a group of nondancers\/nonathletes (n = 872 subjects from 414 families). Dancers scored higher on the Tellegen Absorption Scale, a questionnaire that correlates positively with spirituality and altered states of consciousness, as well as the Reward Dependence factor in Cloninger's Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire, a measure of need for social contact and openness to communication. Highly significant differences in AVPR1a haplotype frequencies (RS1 and RS3), especially when conditional on both SLC6A4 polymorphisms (HTTLPR and VNTR), were observed between dancers and athletes using the UNPHASED program package (Cocaphase: likelihood ratio test [LRS] = 89.23, p = 0.000044). Similar results were obtained when dancers were compared to nondancers\/nonathletes (Cocaphase: LRS = 92.76, p = 0.000024). These results were confirmed using a robust family-based test (Tdtphase: LRS = 46.64, p = 0.010). Association was also observed between Tellegen Absorption Scale scores and AVPR1a (Qtdtphase: global chi-square = 26.53, p = 0.047), SLC6A4 haplotypes (Qtdtphase: chi-square = 2.363, p = 0.018), and AVPR1a conditional on SCL6A4 (Tdtphase: LRS = 250.44, p = 0.011). Similarly, significant association was observed between Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire Reward Dependence scores and AVPR1a RS1 (chi-square = 20.16, p = 0.01). Two-locus analysis (RS1 and RS3 conditional on HTTLPR and VNTR) was highly significant (LRS = 162.95, p = 0.001). Promoter repeat regions in the AVPR1a gene have been robustly demonstrated to play a role in molding a range of social behaviors in many vertebrates and, more recently, in humans. Additionally, serotonergic neurotransmission in some human studies appears to mediate human religious and spiritual experiences. We therefore hypothesize that the association between AVPR1a and SLC6A4 reflects the social communication, courtship, and spiritual facets of the dancing phenotype rather than other aspects of this complex phenotype, such as sensorimotor integration.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16205790"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16205790"],"type":"not_usable","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":""}

To estimate the magnitudes of such effects, we have made an experimental study of the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli. Parameters from cells and cell extracts are used to calculate approximate activity coefficients for cytoplasmic conditions. These calculations require a representation of the sizes, concentrations and effective specific volumes of the macromolecules in the extracts. Macromolecule size representations are obtained either by applying a two-phase distribution assay to define a related homogeneous solution or by using the molecular mass distribution of macromolecules from gel filtration. Macromolecule concentrations in cytoplasm are obtained from analyses of extracts by applying a correction for the dilution that occurs during extraction. That factor is determined from experiments based upon the known impermeability of the cytoplasmic volume to sucrose in intact E. coli. Macromolecule concentrations in the cytoplasm of E. coli in either exponential or stationary growth phase are estimated to be approximately 0.3 to 0.4 g\/ml. Macromolecule specific volumes are inferred from the composition of close-packed precipitates induced by polyethylene glycol. Several well-characterized proteins which bind to DNA (lac repressor, RNA polymerase) are extremely sensitive to changes in salt concentration in studies in vitro, but are insensitive in studies in vivo. Application of the activity coefficients from the present work indicates that at least part of this discrepancy arises from the difference in excluded volumes in these studies. Applications of the activity coefficients to solubility or to association reactions are also discussed, as are changes associated with cell growth phase and osmotic or other effects.

These proteins also exhibit appreciable affinity for nonspecific DNA, and thus this apparently facilitated binding rate must be interpreted in terms of a two-step binding mechanism. The first step involves free diffusion to any nonspecific binding site on the DNA, and the second step comprises a series of protein translocation events that are also driven by thermal fluctuations. Because of nonspecific binding, the search process in the second step is of reduced dimensionality (or volume); this results in an accelerated apparent rate of target location. In this paper we define four types of processes that may be involved in these protein translocation events between DNA sites. These are (i) \"macroscopic\" dissociation--reassociation processes within the domain of the DNA molecule, (ii) \"microscopic\" dissociation--reassociation events between closely spaced sites in the DNA molecule, (iii) \"intersegment transfer\" (via \"ring-closure\") processes between different segments of the DNA molecule, and (iv) \"sliding\" along the DNA molecule. We present mathematical and physical descriptions of each of these processes, and the consequences of each for the overall rate of target location are worked out as a function of both the nonspecific binding affinity between protein and DNA and the length of the DNA molecule containing the target sequence.

Such uniqueness was seemingly necessary to justify the superior cognitive abilities of humans over larger-brained mammals such as elephants and whales. However, our recent studies using a novel method to determine the cellular composition of the brain of humans and other primates as well as of rodents and insectivores show that, since different cellular scaling rules apply to the brains within these orders, brain size can no longer be considered a proxy for the number of neurons in the brain. These studies also showed that the human brain is not exceptional in its cellular composition, as it was found to contain as many neuronal and non-neuronal cells as would be expected of a primate brain of its size. Additionally, the so-called overdeveloped human cerebral cortex holds only 19% of all brain neurons, a fraction that is similar to that found in other mammals. In what regards absolute numbers of neurons, however, the human brain does have two advantages compared to other mammalian brains: compared to rodents, and probably to whales and elephants as well, it is built according to the very economical, space-saving scaling rules that apply to other primates; and, among economically built primate brains, it is the largest, hence containing the most neurons.

The induction of stable LTP was sensitive to stimulation variables on the day of HFS and was associated with phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein. The maintenance of stable LTP was also experience-dependent, because it was reversed when animals were exposed repeatedly to an enriched environment beginning 14 d post-HFS.

We report that high-frequency stimulation (HFS) paradigms applied to the rat dentate gyrus can elicit stable LTP lasting months and up to at least 1 year. The induction of stable LTP was sensitive to stimulation variables on the day of HFS and was associated with phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein. The maintenance of stable LTP was also experience-dependent, because it was reversed when animals were exposed repeatedly to an enriched environment beginning 14 d post-HFS.

In developing neural retina, radial glia-like M\u00fcller cells are generated late in neurogenesis and are not considered to be neuronal progenitors, but they do proliferate after injury and can express neuronal markers, suggesting a latent neurogenic capacity. To examine the neurogenic capacity of retinal glial cells, we used lineage tracing in transgenic zebrafish with a glial-specific promoter (gfap, for glial fibrillary acid protein) driving green fluorescent protein in differentiated M\u00fcller glia. We found that all M\u00fcller glia in the zebrafish retina express low levels of the multipotent progenitor marker Pax6 (paired box gene 6), and they proliferate at a low frequency in the intact, uninjured retina. M\u00fcller glia-derived progenitors express Crx (cone rod homeobox) and are late retinal progenitors that generate the rod photoreceptor lineage in the postembryonic retina. These M\u00fcller glia-derived progenitors also remain competent to produce earlier neuronal lineages, in that they respond to loss of cone photoreceptors by specifically regenerating the missing neurons. We conclude that zebrafish M\u00fcller glia function as multipotent retinal stem cells that generate retinal neurons by homeostatic and regenerative developmental mechanisms.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17596452"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17596452"],"type":"not_usable","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":""}

Although myosin VI has structural differences compared with the other myosins, the mechanism for the reversal of the directionality has not been satisfactorily explained by conventional theories for myosin motility, including the widely accepted lever-arm hypothesis. In this paper, a simple mechanism for determining the directionality is proposed. The mechanism assumes that the driving force for the power stroke is caused by elastic energy stored within a myosin molecule at the joint between the head and the neck. The elastic energy originates from the attractive force between myosin and actin, and accumulates during the docking process. The energy of ATP is used to reduce the attractive force between myosin and actin and to facilitate the dissociation of these molecules. Therefore, it is not directly engaged in the power stroke. With this mechanism, the directionality of the myosin motility is simply determined by the direction of the neck with respect to the head in the dissociated configuration. This structural difference is actually observed in myosin VI. The same mechanism also explains the behavior of a backward moving engineered myosin.

Because of the poor reproductive capacity of ERbeta knockout (BERKO) female mice (small litter size, multiple-resorbed fetuses), the role of uterine ERbeta was explored. In the immature uterus, ERalpha and ERbeta are expressed at comparable levels in the epithelium and stroma, and 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) treatment decreases ERbeta in the stroma. The immature uterus of untreated BERKO mice exhibits elevated levels of progesterone receptor (PR) and the proliferation-associated protein, Ki-67. It also exhibits exaggerated responsiveness to E(2), as indicated by enlargement of the lumen, increase in volume and protein content of uterine secretion, induction of the luminal epithelial secretory protein, complement C3, and its regulatory cytokine IL-1beta, and induction of vascular endothelial growth factor and insulin-like growth factor 1 but not its receptor. As expected, E(2) increased PR in the stroma and decreased it in the luminal epithelium of wild-type mice. In the BERKO uterus, E(2) induced PR in the stroma but did not down-regulate it in the epithelium.

Here, evidence is provided that estrogen-induced Erk-1\/-2 activation occurs independently of known estrogen receptors, but requires the expression of the G protein-coupled receptor homolog, GPR30. We show that 17beta-estradiol activates Erk-1\/-2 not only in MCF-7 cells, which express both estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) and ER beta, but also in SKBR3 breast cancer cells, which fail to express either receptor. Immunoblot analysis using GPR30 peptide antibodies showed that this estrogen response was associated with the presence of GPR30 protein in these cells. MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (ER alpha-, ER beta+) are GPR30 deficient and insensitive to Erk-1\/-2 activation by 17beta-estradiol. Transfection of MDA-MB-231 cells with a GPR30 complementary DNA resulted in overexpression of GPR30 protein and conversion to an estrogen-responsive phenotype. In addition, GPR30-dependent Erk-1\/-2 activation was triggered by ER antagonists, including ICI 182,780, yet not by 17alpha-estradiol or progesterone. Consistent with acting through a G protein-coupled receptor, estradiol signaling to Erk-1\/-2 occurred via a Gbetagamma-dependent, pertussis toxin-sensitive pathway that required Src-related tyrosine kinase activity and tyrosine phosphorylation of tyrosine 317 of the Shc adapter protein. Reinforcing this idea, estradiol signaling to Erk-1\/-2 was dependent upon trans-activation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor via release of heparan-bound EGF (HB-EGF). Estradiol signaling to Erk-1\/-2 could be blocked by: 1) inhibiting EGF-receptor tyrosine kinase activity, 2) neutralizing HB-EGF with antibodies, or 3) down-modulating HB-EGF from the cell surface with the diphtheria toxin mutant, CRM-197.

Mechanisms of damage involve abstractions and addition reactions by free radicals leading to carbon-centered sugar radicals and OH- or H-adduct radicals of heterocyclic bases. Further reactions of these radicals yield numerous products. Various analytical techniques exist for the measurement of oxidative damage to DNA. Techniques that employ gas chromatography (GC) or liquid chromatography (LC) with mass spectrometry (MS) simultaneously measure numerous products, and provide positive identification and accurate quantification. The measurement of multiple products avoids misleading conclusions that might be drawn from the measurement of a single product, because product levels vary depending on reaction conditions and the redox status of cells.

In agreement with this, long-lived animals show lower levels of oxidative damage in their mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) than short-lived ones, whereas this does not occur in nuclear DNA (nDNA). Caloric restriction, which decreases the rate of aging, also decreases mitochondrial oxygen radical generation and oxidative damage to mitochondrial DNA. This decrease in free radical generation occurs in complex I and is due to a decrease in the degree of electronic reduction of the complex I free radical generator, similarly to what has been described in various cases in long-lived animals.

We conclude that i) variegation in this species depends on number and organization of palisade cell layers and can be defined as a \"variable palisade\" type, and ii) the variegated habit has no limiting effects on the photosynthetic energy budget of A. italicum, consistent with the presence of variegated plants side by side to full-green ones in natural populations.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22078376"},{"text":"Variegation in these Begonia is structural, where light areas are created by internal reflection between air spaces and cells in a leaf.

Using a spin-label introduced into the lid of HPL at position 249, a reversible opening of the lid controlling the access to the active site was observed by EPR spectroscopy in the pH range of 3.0-5.0. In the same pH range, some structural changes were also found to occur outside the lid in a peptide stretch located near catalytic aspartate 176, using a spin-label introduced at position 181.

Hence, a method that allows for the simultaneous visualization of endogenous mRNAs and their translation products in living cells is needed. We previously developed a method (m-TAG) to localize endogenously expressed mRNAs in yeast by chromosomal insertion of the MS2 aptamer sequence between the open-reading frame (ORF) and 3' UTR of any gene.

Whole-cell patch-clamp analysis in neurons with newly-formed axons (Stage 3) revealed that rapidly inactivating, low-voltage activated (LVA) and non-inactivating, high-voltage activated (HVA) currents were both inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by acute ethanol, with relatively greater inhibition of HVA currents. When assessed by Fluo-4-AM imaging, baseline fluorescence and Ca2+ response to ethanol in Stage 3 neurons was similar compared to neurons without axons, but peak Ca2+ transient amplitudes in response to bath-applied KCl were greater in Stage 3 neurons and were decreased by acute ethanol. The amplitude of Ca2+ transients elicited specifically in axonal growth cones by focal application of KCl was also inhibited by acute exposure to moderate-to-high concentrations of ethanol (43 or 87 mM), whereas a lower concentration (22 mM) had no effect. When 43 or 87 mM ethanol was present continuously in the medium, KCl-evoked Ca2+ transient amplitudes were also reduced in growth cones.

Visualization using a fluorescent dihydropyridine analog revealed that neurons continuously exposed to ethanol expressed increased amounts of L-type Ca2+ channels, with greater increases in axonal growth cones than cell bodies. Thus, acute ethanol reduces Ca2+ current and KCl-induced Ca2+ responses in whole cells and axonal growth cones, respectively, and chronic exposure is also generally inhibitory despite apparent up-regulation of L-type channel expression. These results are consistent with a role for altered growth cone Ca2+ signaling in abnormal neuromorphogenesis associated with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21664257"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21664257"],"type":"not_usable","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":""}

Consequently, we tested a commercially available nasal spray containing iota-carrageenan in an influenza A mouse infection model. Treatment of mice infected with a lethal dose of influenza A PR8\/34 H1N1 virus with iota-carrageenan starting up to 48 hours post infection resulted in a strong protection of mice similar to mice treated with oseltamivir. Since alternative treatment options for influenza are rare, we conclude that the nasal spray containing iota-carrageenan is an alternative to neuraminidase inhibitors and should be tested for prevention and treatment of influenza A in clinical trials in humans.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21179403"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16839203","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18817582","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21179403"],"type":"factoid","exact_answer":"preventing the binding of HPV virions","ideal_answer":"Carrageenan acts primarily by preventing the binding of HPV virions to cells.

{"body":"How are there alternative initiation codons?","snippets":[{"text":"The mechanisms whereby ribosomes engage a messenger RNA and select the start site for translation differ between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Initiation sites in polycistronic prokaryotic mRNAs are usually selected via base pairing with ribosomal RNA. That straightforward mechanism is made complicated and interesting by cis- and trans-acting elements employed to regulate translation. Initiation sites in eukaryotic mRNAs are reached via a scanning mechanism which predicts that translation should start at the AUG codon nearest the 5' end of the mRNA. Interest has focused on mechanisms that occasionally allow escape from this first-AUG rule. With natural mRNAs, three escape mechanisms - context-dependent leaky scanning, reinitiation, and possibly direct internal initiation - allow access to AUG codons which, although not first, are still close to the 5' end of the mRNA. This constraint on the initiation step of translation in eukaryotes dictates the location of transcriptional promoters and may have contributed to the evolution of splicing.The binding of Met-tRNA to ribosomes is mediated by a GTP-binding protein in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, but the more complex structure of the eukaryotic factor (eIF-2) and its association with other proteins underlie some aspects of initiation unique to eukaryotes. Modulation of GTP hydrolysis by eIF-2 is important during the scanning phase of initiation, while modulating the release of GDP from eIF-2 is a key mechanism for regulating translation in eukaryotes. Our understanding of how some other protein factors participate in the initiation phase of translation is in flux. Genetic tests suggest that some proteins conventionally counted as eukaryotic initiation factors may not be required for translation, while other tests have uncovered interesting new candidates. Some popular ideas about the initiation pathway are predicated on static interactions between isolated factors and mRNA. The need for functional testing of these complexes is discussed. Interspersed with these theoretical topics are some practical points concerning the interpretation of cDNA sequences and the use of in vitro translation systems. Some human diseases resulting from defects in the initiation step of translation are also discussed.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10395892"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10395892"],"type":"not_usable","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":""}

Using support vector machines and linear regression models, we found that in the primary visual cortex (V1) of monkeys, spikes can indeed be inferred from LFPs, at least with moderate success. Although there is a considerable degree of variation across electrodes, the low-frequency structure in spike trains (in the 100-ms range) can be inferred with reasonable accuracy, whereas exact spike positions are not reliably predicted. Two kinds of features of the LFP are exploited for prediction: the frequency power of bands in the high gamma-range (40-90 Hz) and information contained in low-frequency oscillations (<10 Hz), where both phase and power modulations are informative. Information analysis revealed that both features code (mainly) independent aspects of the spike-to-LFP relationship, with the low-frequency LFP phase coding for temporally clustered spiking activity. Although both features and prediction quality are similar during seminatural movie stimuli and spontaneous activity, prediction performance during spontaneous activity degrades much more slowly with increasing electrode distance. The general trend of data obtained with anesthetized animals is qualitatively mirrored in that of a more limited data set recorded in V1 of non-anesthetized monkeys. In contrast to the cortical field potentials, thalamic LFPs (e.g., LFPs derived from recordings in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus) hold no useful information for predicting spiking activity.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18160425"},{"text":"Local field potentials (LFPs) reflect subthreshold integrative processes that complement spike train measures.

We then determined how the power of LFPs and spikes at different frequencies represents the visual features in the movie. We found that the most informative LFP frequency ranges were 1-8 and 60-100 Hz. LFPs in the range of 12-40 Hz carried little information about the stimulus, and may primarily reflect neuromodulatory inputs. Spike power was informative only at frequencies <12 Hz. We further quantified \"signal correlations\" (correlations in the trial-averaged power response to different stimuli) and \"noise correlations\" (trial-by-trial correlations in the fluctuations around the average) of LFPs and spikes recorded from the same electrode. We found positive signal correlation between high-gamma LFPs (60-100 Hz) and spikes, as well as strong positive signal correlation within high-gamma LFPs, suggesting that high-gamma LFPs and spikes are generated within the same network. LFPs <24 Hz shared strong positive noise correlations, indicating that they are influenced by a common source, such as a diffuse neuromodulatory input. LFPs <40 Hz showed very little signal and noise correlations with LFPs >40 Hz and with spikes, suggesting that low-frequency LFPs reflect neural processes that in natural conditions are fully decoupled from those giving rise to spikes and to high-gamma LFPs.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18509031"},{"text":"Local field potentials and the underlying endogenous electric fields (EFs) are traditionally considered to be epiphenomena of structured neuronal network activity.

Modulation of network activity by positive and negative feedback fields based on the network activity in real-time provide direct evidence for a feedback loop between neuronal activity and endogenous EF.

Understanding the relationships between single-neuron spiking and network activity is therefore of great importance and the latter can be readily estimated from low-frequency brain signals known as local field potentials (LFPs). In this work we examine a number of issues related to the estimation of spike and LFP signals. We show that spike trains and individual spikes contain power at the frequencies that are typically thought to be exclusively related to LFPs, such that simple frequency-domain filtering cannot be effectively used to separate the two signals. Ground-truth simulations indicate that the commonly used method of estimating the LFP signal by low-pass filtering the raw voltage signal leads to artifactual correlations between spikes and LFPs and that these correlations exert a powerful influence on popular metrics of spike-LFP synchronization. Similar artifactual results were seen in data obtained from electrophysiological recordings in macaque visual cortex, when low-pass filtering was used to estimate LFP signals. In contrast LFP tuning curves in response to sensory stimuli do not appear to be affected by spike contamination, either in simulations or in real data. To address the issue of spike contamination, we devised a novel Bayesian spike removal algorithm and confirmed its effectiveness in simulations and by applying it to the electrophysiological data. The algorithm, based on a rigorous mathematical framework, outperforms other methods of spike removal on most metrics of spike-LFP correlations. Following application of this spike removal algorithm, many of our electrophysiological recordings continued to exhibit spike-LFP correlations, confirming previous reports that such relationships are a genuine aspect of neuronal activity. Overall, these results show that careful preprocessing is necessary to remove spikes from LFP signals, but that when effective spike removal is used, spike-LFP correlations can potentially yield novel insights about brain function.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21068271"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18160425","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18509031","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20624597","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21068271"],"type":"yesno","exact_answer":"yes","ideal_answer":"Although there is a considerable degree of variation across electrodes, the low-frequency structure in spike trains (in the 100-ms range) can be inferred with reasonable accuracy, whereas exact spike positions are not reliably predicted."}

Here, we address the issue of the compatibility of these two replicating systems. Fatty acids form vesicles that are able to grow and divide, but vesicles composed solely of fatty acids are incompatible with the folding and activity of most ribozymes, because low concentrations of divalent cations (e.g., Mg(2+)) cause fatty acids to precipitate. Furthermore, vesicles that grow and divide must be permeable to the cations and substrates required for internal metabolism. We used a mixture of myristoleic acid and its glycerol monoester to construct vesicles that were Mg(2+)-tolerant and found that Mg(2+) cations can permeate the membrane and equilibrate within a few minutes. In vesicles encapsulating a hammerhead ribozyme, the addition of external Mg(2+) led to the activation and self-cleavage of the ribozyme molecules. Vesicles composed of these amphiphiles grew spontaneously through osmotically driven competition between vesicles, and further modification of the membrane composition allowed growth following mixed micelle addition. Our results show that membranes made from simple amphiphiles can form vesicles that are stable enough to retain encapsulated RNAs in the presence of divalent cations, yet dynamic enough to grow spontaneously and allow the passage of Mg(2+) and mononucleotides without specific macromolecular transporters. This combination of stability and dynamics is critical for building model protocells in the laboratory and may have been important for early cellular evolution.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16173749"},{"text":"An RNA enzyme that catalyzes the RNA-templated joining of RNA was converted to a format whereby two enzymes catalyze each other's synthesis from a total of four oligonucleotide substrates.

The aim of this study was to determine whether lipid analysis by a combination of thin layer chromatography (TLC) with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) could be used as a strain-typing technique in order to distinguish S. pastorianus syn. carlsbergensis strain 34\/70 from strain 34\/78. Both strains (34\/70 and 34\/78) were harvested after continuous culture under standard conditions. Polar lipids were then extracted from lyophilized cultures and analysed by TLC in order to separate phospholipid families. Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) was extracted and investigated using ESI-MS, to gain further information on individual molecular species. Using TLC analysis, lipids were separated corresponding to standards for PE, phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), cardiolipin (CL), phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidic acid (PA) and sphingomyelin (SM). ESI-MS of the PE band, separated by TLC, showed that electrospray mass spectra were highly reproducible for repeat cultures. Novel findings were that both brewing strains displayed major phospholipid peaks with m\/z 714, PE (34 : 2) m\/z 742, PE (36 : 2) and m\/z 758, PE (37 : 1).

A similar model of a horse (Equus caballus) was used as a control, and its floating behaviour replicates the observed orientations of immersed horses. The floating giraffe model has its neck sub-horizontal, and the animal would struggle to keep its head clear of the water surface. Using an isometrically scaled-down giraffe model with a total mass equal to that of the horse, the giraffe's proportionally larger limbs have much higher rotational inertias than do those of horses, and their wetted surface areas are 13.5% greater relative to that of the horse, thus making rapid swimming motions more strenuous. The mean density of the giraffe model (960 gm\/l) is also higher than that of the horse (930 gm\/l), and closer to that causing negative buoyancy (1000 gm\/l). A swimming giraffe - forced into a posture where the neck is sub-horizontal and with a thorax that is pulled downwards by the large fore limbs - would not be able to move the neck and limbs synchronously as giraffes do when moving on land, possibly further hampering the animal's ability to move its limbs effectively underwater.

Induction of Glut5 during ontogenetic development appears to be specifically mediated by GR translocation to the nucleus and subsequent binding to the Glut5 promoter, whereas the glucocorticoid-independent regulation of Sglt1 by age was not associated with any GR binding to the Sglt1 promoter.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21222652"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21222652"],"type":"not_usable","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":""}

In theory, menopause can evolve via inclusive fitness benefits [5, 6], but the mechanisms by which postreproductive females help their kin remain enigmatic. One hypothesis is that postreproductive females act as repositories of ecological knowledge and thereby buffer kin against environmental hardships [7, 8]. We provide the first test of this hypothesis using a unique long-term dataset on wild resident killer whales. We show three key results. First, postreproductively aged females lead groups during collective movement in salmon foraging grounds. Second, leadership by postreproductively aged females is especially prominent in difficult years when salmon abundance is low. This finding is critical because salmon abundance drives both mortality and reproductive success in resident killer whales [9, 10]. Third, females are more likely to lead their sons than they are to\u00a0lead their daughters, supporting predictions of recent models [5] of the evolution of menopause based on kinship dynamics.

But an abrupt reproductive decline might be only a non-adaptive by-product of life-history patterns. Because so many individuals die from starvation, disease and predation, detrimental genetic traits can persist (or even be favoured) as long as their deleterious effects are delayed until an advanced age is reached, and, for a given pattern of mortality, there should be an age by which selection would be too weak to prevent the onset of reproductive senescence. We provide a systematic test of these alternatives using field data from two species in which grandmothers frequently engage in kin-directed behaviour.

Disturbance of the renal circadian rhythms is increasingly recognized as a risk factor for hypertension, polyuria, and other diseases and may contribute to renal fibrosis. The origin of these rhythms has been attributed to the reactive response of the kidney to circadian changes in volume and\/or in the composition of extracellular fluids that are entrained by rest\/activity and feeding\/fasting cycles. However, numerous studies have shown that most of the renal excretory rhythms persist for long periods of time, even in the absence of periodic environmental cues. These observations led to the hypothesis of the existence of a self-sustained mechanism, enabling the kidney to anticipate various predictable circadian challenges to homeostasis. The molecular basis of this mechanism remained unknown until the recent discovery of the mammalian circadian clock made of a system of autoregulatory transcriptional\/translational feedback loops, which have been found in all tissues studied, including the kidney.

The goal of the present study was to assess the specific role of the amygdala in the recognition of fear from music. To this aim, we investigated a rare subject, S.M., who has complete bilateral damage relatively restricted to the amygdala and not encompassing other sectors of the temporal lobe. In Experiment 1, S.M. and four matched controls were asked to rate the intensity of fear, peacefulness, happiness, and sadness from computer-generated instrumental music purposely created to express those emotions. Subjects also rated the arousal and valence of each musical stimulus. An error detection task assessed basic auditory perceptual function. S.M. performed normally in this perceptual task, but was selectively impaired in the recognition of scary and sad music. In contrast, her recognition of happy music was normal. Furthermore, S.M. judged the scary music to be less arousing and the peaceful music less relaxing than did the controls. Overall, the pattern of impairment in S.M. is similar to that previously reported in patients with unilateral anteromedial temporal lobe damage. S.M.'s impaired emotional judgments occur in the face of otherwise intact processing of musical features that are emotionally determinant. The use of tempo and mode cues in distinguishing happy from sad music was also spared in S.M. Thus, the amygdala appears to be necessary for emotional processing of music rather than the perceptual processing itself.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16970965"},{"text":"Musical emotions, such as happiness and sadness, have been investigated using instrumental music devoid of linguistic content.

We extracted samples from subjects' selections of sad and happy pieces and sorted them according to the presence of lyrics. Acoustic feature analysis showed that music with lyrics differed from music without lyrics in spectral centroid, a feature related to perceptual brightness, whereas sad music with lyrics did not diverge from happy music without lyrics, indicating the role of other factors in emotion classification. Behavioral ratings revealed that happy music without lyrics induced stronger positive emotions than happy music with lyrics. We also acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging data while subjects performed affective tasks regarding the music.

Additionally, contrasts between sad music with versus without lyrics recruited the parahippocampal gyrus, the amygdala, the claustrum, the putamen, the precentral gyrus, the medial and inferior frontal gyri (including Broca's area), and the auditory cortex, while the reverse contrast produced no activations. Happy music without lyrics activated structures of the limbic system and the right pars opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus, whereas auditory regions alone responded to happy music with lyrics.

Exceptionally slow-growing trees of this species have been found with ring counts to 1653 years and estimated ages to 1890 years. Senescence is slow or absent. Injury and death is due to rockfall and sporadic severe drought that kills small sectors of the trees by exposing and killing the roots. Experiments in which colored dyes are infused into roots show that each tree is composed of hydraulically independent units that allow mortality in one part of the 'individual' with little negative effect on the remaining parts of the tree. The trees are small, so environmental loadings of ice, snow, and wind are low. Slow growth of the trees results in a much greater mechanical strength in the wood. Together these properties increase the ability of the cedars to persist on cliffs for long periods of time.

Using these data, we built a genetic model that includes 281 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and discriminated between cases and controls of the discovery set with 89% sensitivity and specificity, and with 58% specificity and 60% sensitivity in an independent cohort of 341 controls and 253 genetically matched nonagenarians and centenarians (median age 100 years). Consistent with the hypothesis that the genetic contribution is largest with the oldest ages, the sensitivity of the model increased in the independent cohort with older and older ages (71% to classify subjects with an age at death>102 and 85% to classify subjects with an age at death>105). For further validation, we applied the model to an additional, unmatched 60 centenarians (median age 107 years) resulting in 78% sensitivity, and 2863 unmatched controls with 61% specificity. The 281 SNPs include the SNP rs2075650 in TOMM40\/APOE that reached irrefutable genome wide significance (posterior probability of association\u200a=\u200a1) and replicated in the independent cohort. Removal of this SNP from the model reduced the accuracy by only 1%.

Surprisingly, the amides are not generated by a transamidation reaction. Instead, the hormones are synthesized from glycine-extended intermediates that are transformed into active amidated hormones by oxidative cleavage of the glycine N-C alpha bond. In higher organisms, this reaction is catalyzed by a single bifunctional enzyme, peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase (PAM). The PAM gene encodes one polypeptide with two enzymes that catalyze the two sequential reactions required for amidation. Peptidylglycine alpha-hydroxylating monooxygenase (PHM; EC 1.14.17.3) catalyzes the stereospecific hydroxylation of the glycine alpha-carbon of all the peptidylglycine substrates. The second enzyme, peptidyl-alpha-hydroxyglycine alpha-amidating lyase (PAL; EC 4.3.2.5), generates alpha-amidated peptide product and glyoxylate. PHM contains two redox-active copper atoms that, after reduction by ascorbate, catalyze the reduction of molecular oxygen for the hydroxylation of glycine-extended substrates. The structure of the catalytic core of rat PHM at atomic resolution provides a framework for understanding the broad substrate specificity of PHM, identifying residues critical for PHM activity, and proposing mechanisms for the chemical and electron-transfer steps in catalysis. Since PHM is homologous in sequence and mechanism to dopamine beta-monooxygenase (DBM; EC 1.14.17.1), the enzyme that converts dopamine to norepinephrine during catecholamine biosynthesis, these structural and mechanistic insights are extended to DBM.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11028916"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11028916"],"type":"not_usable","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":""}

Feeding time is the dominant zeitgeber for peripheral mammalian clocks: Daytime feeding of nocturnal laboratory rodents completely inverts the phase of circadian gene expression in many tissues, including liver, heart, kidney, and pancreas, but it has no effect on the SCN pacemaker. It is thus plausible that in intact animals, the SCN synchronizes peripheral docks primarily through temporal feeding patterns that are imposed through behavioral rest-activity cycles. In addition, body temperature rhythms, which are themselves dependent on both feeding patterns and rest-activity cycles, can sustain circadian, clock gene activity in vivo and in vitro. The SCN may also influence the phase of rhythmic gene expression in peripheral tissues through direct chemical pathways. In fact, many chemical signals induce circadian gene expression in tissue culture cells. Some of these have been shown to elicit phase shifts when injected into intact animals and are thus candidates for physiologically relevant timing cues. While the response of the SCN to light is strictly gated to respond only during the night, peripheral oscillators can be chemically phase shifted throughout the day.

{"body":"How Does Green Tea Increase Metabolic Rate?","snippets":[{"text":"Caffeine is the most widely consumed central-nervous-system stimulant. Three main mechanisms of action of caffeine on the central nervous system have been described. Mobilization of intracellular calcium and inhibition of specific phosphodiesterases only occur at high non-physiological concentrations of caffeine. The only likely mechanism of action of the methylxanthine is the antagonism at the level of adenosine receptors. Caffeine increases energy metabolism throughout the brain but decreases at the same time cerebral blood flow, inducing a relative brain hypoperfusion. Caffeine activates noradrenaline neurons and seems to affect the local release of dopamine. Many of the alerting effects of caffeine may be related to the action of the methylxanthine on serotonin neurons. The methylxanthine induces dose-response increases in locomotor activity in animals. Its psychostimulant action on man is, however, often subtle and not very easy to detect. The effects of caffeine on learning, memory, performance and coordination are rather related to the methylxanthine action on arousal, vigilance and fatigue. Caffeine exerts obvious effects on anxiety and sleep which vary according to individual sensitivity to the methylxanthine. However, children in general do not appear more sensitive to methylxanthine effects than adults. The central nervous system does not seem to develop a great tolerance to the effects of caffeine although dependence and withdrawal symptoms are reported.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1356551"},{"text":"Tea consumption is varying its status from a mere ancient beverage and a lifestyle habit, to a nutrient endowed with possible prospective neurobiological-pharmacological actions beneficial to human health.

In this regard, a network of descending pathways projecting from cerebral structures to the DH plays a complex and crucial role. Specific centrifugal pathways either suppress (descending inhibition) or potentiate (descending facilitation) passage of nociceptive messages to the brain. Engagement of descending inhibition by the opioid analgesic, morphine, fulfils an important role in its pain-relieving properties, while induction of analgesia by the adrenergic agonist, clonidine, reflects actions at alpha(2)-adrenoceptors (alpha(2)-ARs) in the DH normally recruited by descending pathways. However, opioids and adrenergic agents exploit but a tiny fraction of the vast panoply of mechanisms now known to be involved in the induction and\/or expression of descending controls. For example, no drug interfering with descending facilitation is currently available for clinical use. The present review focuses on: (1) the organisation of descending pathways and their pathophysiological significance; (2) the role of individual transmitters and specific receptor types in the modulation and expression of mechanisms of descending inhibition and facilitation and (3) the advantages and limitations of established and innovative analgesic strategies which act by manipulation of descending controls.

This finding strongly suggests that the proliferation of this family has been almost entirely due to germ-line reinfection, rather than retrotransposition in cis or complementation in trans, and that an infectious pool of endogenous retroviruses has persisted within the primate lineage throughout the past 30 million years. Because many elements within this pool would have been unfixed, it is possible that the HERV-K(HML2) family still contains infectious elements at present, despite their apparent absence in the human genome sequence.

Accrual of such damage over time was postulated to be responsible for the physiological deterioration in the postreproductive phase of life and eventually the death of the organism. This \"structural damage-based oxidative stress\" hypothesis has received support from the age-associated increases in the rate of ROS production and the steady-state amounts of oxidized macromolecules; however, there are increasing indications that structural damage alone is insufficient to satisfactorily explain the age-associated functional losses. The level of oxidative damage accrued during aging often does not match the magnitude of functional losses. Although experimental augmentation of antioxidant defenses tends to enhance resistance to induced oxidative stress, such manipulations are generally ineffective in the extension of life span of long-lived strains of animals.

These structural data provide an invaluable knowledge base not only for understanding DNA-protein interactions, but also for developing specialized methods that predict the DNA-binding function from protein structure. While such methods are useful, a major limitation is that they require an experimental structure of the target as input. To overcome this obstacle, we develop a threading-based method, DNA-Binding-Domain-Threader (DBD-Threader), for the prediction of DNA-binding domains and associated DNA-binding protein residues. Our method, which uses a template library composed of DNA-protein complex structures, requires only the target protein's sequence. In our approach, fold similarity and DNA-binding propensity are employed as two functional discriminating properties. In benchmark tests on 179 DNA-binding and 3,797 non-DNA-binding proteins, using templates whose sequence identity is less than 30% to the target, DBD-Threader achieves a sensitivity\/precision of 56%\/86%. This performance is considerably better than the standard sequence comparison method PSI-BLAST and is comparable to DBD-Hunter, which requires an experimental structure as input. Moreover, for over 70% of predicted DNA-binding domains, the backbone Root Mean Square Deviations (RMSDs) of the top-ranked structural models are within 6.5 A of their experimental structures, with their associated DNA-binding sites identified at satisfactory accuracy. Additionally, DBD-Threader correctly assigned the SCOP superfamily for most predicted domains. To demonstrate that DBD-Threader is useful for automatic function annotation on a large-scale, DBD-Threader was applied to 18,631 protein sequences from the human genome; 1,654 proteins are predicted to have DNA-binding function.

Transcription factors often bind DNA as multiprotein complexes, raising the possibility that complex formation might modify their DNA binding specificities. To test this hypothesis, we developed an experimental and computational platform, SELEX-seq, that can be used to determine the relative affinities to any DNA sequence for any transcription factor complex. Applying this method to all eight Drosophila Hox proteins, we show that they obtain novel recognition properties when they bind DNA with the dimeric cofactor Extradenticle-Homothorax (Exd). Exd-Hox specificities group into three main classes that obey Hox gene collinearity rules and DNA structure predictions suggest that anterior and posterior Hox proteins prefer DNA sequences with distinct minor groove topographies. Together, these data suggest that emergent DNA recognition properties revealed by interactions with cofactors contribute to transcription factor specificities in vivo.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22153072"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22153072"],"type":"not_usable","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":""}

Accordingly, messenger RNAs for the three inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) subtypes were found to be present throughout spermatogenesis. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed distinct distribution patterns of the mature IP3Rs during sperm differentiation. At early stages, IP3Rs are distributed throughout the cytoplasm, and as differentiation proceeds they become selectively localised to the Golgi complex. Consistently, spermatogonia underwent large intracellular Ca2+ release in response to thapsigargin (TG), while smaller responses were detected in late spermatocytes and spermatids. The distribution of IP3Rs and the larger Ca(2+)-release responses found in spermatogonia, suggest that IP3Rs may be involved in cell proliferation at this stage. This notion is supported by our observations in a spermatogenic cell line that depletion of intracellular Ca2+ pools using TG inhibits cell division, and that incubation with an IP3R-I antisense oligonucleotide completely inhibited proliferation. Furthermore, the three genes encoding ryanodine receptor proteins (RyRs) are expressed at all stages of spermatogenesis. However, immunocytochemical studies with specific antibodies against each of the RyR subtypes detected types 1 and 3 in spermatogenic cells and only type 3 in mature sperm. In contrast to IP3Rs, RyRs remain scattered in the cytoplasm throughout differentiation. Functional responses to caffeine and ryanodine were absent in spermatogenic cells and in mature sperm. These findings suggest that IP3Rs have significantly more important roles in spermatogenesis than RyRs, and that one of these roles is crucial for cell proliferation.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9770782"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9770782"],"type":"yesno","exact_answer":"no","ideal_answer":"Functional responses to caffeine and ryanodine were absent in spermatogenic cells and in mature sperm"}

Here we have reported the solution structure of a VSG type 2 C-terminal domain from MITat1.2, completing the first structure of both domains of a VSG. The isolated C-terminal domain is a monomer in solution and forms a novel fold, which commences with a short alpha-helix followed by a single turn of 3(10)-helix and connected by a short loop to a small anti-parallel beta-sheet and then a longer alpha-helix at the C terminus. This compact domain is flanked by two unstructured regions. The structured part of the domain contains 42 residues, and the core comprises 2 disulfide bonds and 2 hydrophobic residues. These cysteines and hydrophobic residues are conserved in other VSGs, and we have modeled the structures of two further VSG C-terminal domains using the structure of MITat1.2. The models suggest that the overall structure of the core is conserved in the different VSGs but that the C-terminal alpha-helix is of variable length and depends on the presence of charged residues.

In tandem with this accumulation of sequence data, worldwide structural genomics initiatives, advanced by the development of improved technologies in X-ray crystallography and NMR, are expanding our knowledge of structural families and increasing our fold libraries. Methods for detecting remote sequence similarities have also been made more sensitive and this means that we can map domains from these structural families onto genome sequences to understand how these families are distributed throughout the genomes and reveal how they might influence the functional repertoires and biological complexities of the organisms. We have used robust protocols to assign sequences from completed genomes to domain structures in the CATH database, allowing up to 60% of domain sequences in these genomes, depending on the organism, to be assigned to a domain family of known structure. Analysis of the distribution of these families throughout bacterial genomes identified more than 300 universal families, some of which had expanded significantly in proportion to genome size. These highly expanded families are primarily involved in metabolism and regulation and appear to make major contributions to the functional repertoire and complexity of bacterial organisms. When comparisons are made across all kingdoms of life, we find a smaller set of universal domain families (approx. 140), of which families involved in protein biosynthesis are the largest conserved component. Analysis of the behaviour of other families reveals that some (e.g. those involved in metabolism, regulation) have remained highly innovative during evolution, making it harder to trace their evolutionary ancestry. Structural analyses of metabolic families provide some insights into the mechanisms of functional innovation, which include changes in domain partnerships and significant structural embellishments leading to modulation of active sites and protein interactions.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16524831"},{"text":"Finding structural similarities in distantly related proteins can reveal functional relationships that can not be identified using sequence comparison.

Initially a partial model was built into an electron density map based on multiple isomorphous replacement phases and improved by phase combination methods. Subsequently this model was used to obtain the molecular replacement solution for a second crystal form, providing starting phases which were refined using 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry averaging.

Although many of these proteins have similar activities to the E.coli MutS, there is significant diversity of function among the MutS family members. This diversity is even seen within species; many species encode multiple MutS homologs with distinct functions. To better characterize the MutS protein family, I have used a combination of phylogenetic reconstructions and analysis of complete genome sequences. This phylogenomic analysis is used to infer the evolutionary relationships among the MutS family members and to divide the family into subfamilies of orthologs. Analysis of the distribution of these orthologs in particular species and examination of the relationships within and between subfamilies is used to identify likely evolutionary events (e.g. gene duplications, lateral transfer and gene loss) in the history of the MutS family. In particular, evidence is presented that a gene duplication early in the evolution of life resulted in two main MutS lineages, one including proteins known to function in mismatch repair and the other including proteins known to function in chromosome segregation and crossing-over. The inferred evolutionary history of the MutS family is used to make predictions about some of the uncharacterized genes and species included in the analysis.

However, most previous studies of its shear protection mechanisms have typically been qualitative in nature and have not covered a wide range of PF-68 and cell concentrations. In this study, interactions between air bubbles along with the associated cell damage were investigated using the novel adenovirus-producing cell line PER.C6, a human embryonic retinoblast transfected with the adenovirus type 5 E1 gene. A wide range of PF-68 and cell concentrations (approximately 3 orders of magnitude) were used in these studies. At low PF-68 concentrations (0.001 g\/L), cells had a very high affinity for bubbles, indicated by a more than 10-fold increase in cell concentration in the foam layer liquid versus the bulk liquid. At high PF-68 concentrations ( approximately 3 g\/L), however, the cell concentration in the foam layer liquid was only approximately 40% of that in the bulk cell suspension. The number of cells associated with each bubble decreased from approximately 1000 cells at 0.001 g\/L PF-68 to approximately 120 cells at 3 g\/L PF-68. Despite the lower cell affinity for bubbles at a high PF-68 concentration, at high cell concentrations (10(7) cells\/mL and 1 g\/L PF-68) significant cell entrapment occurred in the foam layer, on the order of 1000 cells\/bubble. For the cells carried by the bubbles, quantitative cell damage data revealed that the probability of cell death from bubble rupture was independent of bulk cell concentration but was affected by PF-68 concentration. These quantitative studies further indicated that even at a low PF-68 concentration of 0.03 g\/L, approximately 30% of the attached cells were killed during the bubble rupture process. At the same time, at low PF-68 concentration (<0.1 g\/L), significant cell death occurred prior to bubble rupture. On average, a bubble disrupted more cells in the bulk liquid and\/or foam layer than during rupture. For both mechanisms, the number of cells damaged by each bubble increased with decreasing PF-68 concentration and increasing bulk cell concentration.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15296446"},{"text":"Podocytes are exposed to mechanical forces arising from glomerular capillary pressure and filtration. It has been shown that stretch affects podocyte biology in vitro and plays a significant role in the development of glomerulosclerosis in vivo. However, whether podocytes are sensitive to fluid shear stress is completely unknown. In the present study, we therefore exposed cells of a recently generated conditionally immortalized mouse podocyte cell line to defined fluid shear stress in a flow chamber, mimicking flow of the glomerular ultrafiltrate over the surface of podocytes in Bowman's space. Shear stress above 0.25 dyne\/cm(2) resulted in dramatic loss of podocytes but not of proximal tubular epithelial cells (LLC-PK(1) cells) after 20 h. At 0.015-0.25 dyne\/cm(2), lamellipodia formation in podocytes was enhanced and the actin nucleation protein cortactin was redistributed to the cell margins. Shear stress further diminished stress fibers and the presence of vinculin in focal adhesions. Linear zonula occludens-1 distribution at cell-cell contacts remained unaffected at low shear stress. At 0.25 dyne\/cm(2), the monolayer was broken up and remaining cell-cell contacts were reinforced by F-actin and alpha-actinin. Because the cytoskeletal changes induced by shear stress suggested the involvement of tyrosine kinases (TKs), we tested several TK inhibitors that were all without effect on podocyte number under static conditions. At 0.25 dyne\/cm(2), however, the TK inhibitors genistein and AG 82 were associated with marked podocyte loss. Our data demonstrate that podocytes are highly sensitive to fluid shear stress.

Pipetting embryos is necessary for many protocols, from in vitro fertilization to collecting embryos prior to analyzing gene expression by microarrays. We sought to determine if pipetting upregulates phosphorylated MAPK8\/9 (formerly known as stress-activated protein kinase\/jun kinase\/SAPK\/JNK1, 2). We found that phosphorylated MAPK8\/9, a marker of MAPK8\/9 activation, is upregulated in a dose-dependent manner by pipetting. Whereas embryos with the zona pellucida removed were more sensitive to stress-induced lethality mediated by 1.2 dynes\/cm(2) shear force, phosphorylated MAPK8\/9 was induced at lower numbers of pipet triturations in hatched embryos at E4.5. E4.5 embryos were more sensitive to induction of MAPK8\/9 than unhatched embryos at E2.5 or E3.5. E3.5 embryos also showed a pipetting dose-dependent induction of FOS protein (formerly known as c-fos), a marker of shear stress in many cell types. Phosphorylated MAPK8\/9 measured in ex vivo embryos from E1.5 to E4.5 were expressed at low levels. Embryos that had been pipetted sufficiently to induce phosphorylated MAPK8\/9 and FOS had the same number of cells as untreated embryos 24 hr later. This suggests that rapid phosphorylation of MAPK8\/9 due to transient shear stress does not mediate long-term negative biological outcomes. But, it is possible that techniques requiring multiple handling events would induce MAPK8\/9 and cause biological outcomes or that other biological outcomes are affected by low amounts of transient shear stress. This study suggests that embryo handling prior to experimental measurement of signal transduction phosphoproteins, proteins and mRNA should be performed with care. Indeed, it is likely that shear stress may cause rapid transient changes in hundreds of proteins and mRNA.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17492777"},{"text":"A series of careful studies has been made on blood damage in a rotational viscometer.

By analysis of these results and those of prior workers it is shown that the exposure time-shear stress plane is divided into two distinct regimes. In the regime of relatively low stresses and exposure times there is relatively little damage, and the damage is dominated by solid surface interaction effects.

A well-recognised short-term consequence of UVR is increased skin pigmentation. Pigmentation, whether constitutive or facultative, has widely been viewed as photoprotective, largely because darkly pigmented skin is at a lower risk of photocarcinogenesis than fair skin. Research is increasingly suggesting that the relationship between pigmentation and photoprotection may be far more complex than previously assumed. For example, photoprotection against erythema and DNA damage has been shown to be independent of level of induced pigmentation in human white skin types. Growing evidence now suggests that UVR induced DNA photodamage, and its repair is one of the signals that stimulates melanogenesis and studies suggest that repeated exposure in skin type IV results in faster DNA repair in comparison to skin type II. These findings suggest that tanning may be a measure of inducible DNA repair capacity, and it is this rather than pigment per se which results in the lower incidence skin cancer observed in darker skinned individuals. This evokes the notion that epidermal pigmentation may in fact be the mammalian equivalent of a bacterial SOS response. Skin colour is one of most conspicuous ways in which humans vary yet the function of melanin remains controversial. Greater understanding of the role of pigmentation in skin is vital if one is to be able to give accurate advice to the general public about both the population at risk of skin carcinogenesis and also public perceptions of a tan as being healthy.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15748643"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15068035","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15748643"],"type":"not_usable","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":""}

They are particularly useful when inbred lines are available, because once these lines have been genotyped they can be phenotyped multiple times, making it possible (as well as extremely cost effective) to study many different traits in many different environments, while replicating the phenotypic measurements to reduce environmental noise. Here we demonstrate the power of this approach by carrying out a GWA study of 107 phenotypes in Arabidopsis thaliana, a widely distributed, predominantly self-fertilizing model plant known to harbour considerable genetic variation for many adaptively important traits.

The review covers all levels of tendon structure from the molecular to the gross and deals both with the extracellular matrix and with tendon cells.

Telomeres are nucleoprotein structures that protect the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes and are particularly vulnerable due to progressive shortening during each round of DNA replication and, thus, a lifetime of tissue renewal places the organism at risk for increasing chromosomal instability. Indeed, telomere erosion has been documented in aging tissues and hyperproliferative disease states-conditions strongly associated with increased cancer risk. Telomere dysfunction can produce the opposing pathophysiological states of degenerative aging or cancer with the specific outcome dictated by the integrity of DNA damage checkpoint responses. In most advanced cancers, telomerase is reactivated and serves to maintain telomere length and emerging data have also documented the capacity of telomerase to directly regulate cancer-promoting pathways. This review covers the role of telomeres and telomerase in the biology of normal tissue stem\/progenitor cells and in the development of cancer.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19887512"},{"text":"Advanced age is the main risk factor for most chronic diseases and functional deficits in humans, but the fundamental mechanisms that drive ageing remain largely unknown, impeding the development of interventions that might delay or prevent age-related disorders and maximize healthy lifespan. Cellular senescence, which halts the proliferation of damaged or dysfunctional cells, is an important mechanism to constrain the malignant progression of tumour cells. Senescent cells accumulate in various tissues and organs with ageing and have been hypothesized to disrupt tissue structure and function because of the components they secrete. However, whether senescent cells are causally implicated in age-related dysfunction and whether their removal is beneficial has remained unknown. To address these fundamental questions, we made use of a biomarker for senescence, p16(Ink4a), to design a novel transgene, INK-ATTAC, for inducible elimination of p16(Ink4a)-positive senescent cells upon administration of a drug. Here we show that in the BubR1 progeroid mouse background, INK-ATTAC removes p16(Ink4a)-positive senescent cells upon drug treatment. In tissues--such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and eye--in which p16(Ink4a) contributes to the acquisition of age-related pathologies, life-long removal of p16(Ink4a)-expressing cells delayed onset of these phenotypes. Furthermore, late-life clearance attenuated progression of already established age-related disorders. These data indicate that cellular senescence is causally implicated in generating age-related phenotypes and that removal of senescent cells can prevent or delay tissue dysfunction and extend healthspan.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22048312"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19887512","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22048312"],"type":"not_usable","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":""}

However, whether or not adult beta cell progenitors exist is one of the most controversial issues in today's diabetes research. Guided by the expression of Neurogenin 3 (Ngn3), the earliest islet cell-specific transcription factor in embryonic development, we show that beta cell progenitors can be activated in injured adult mouse pancreas and are located in the ductal lining. Differentiation of the adult progenitors is Ngn3 dependent and gives rise to all islet cell types, including glucose responsive beta cells that subsequently proliferate, both in situ and when cultured in embryonic pancreas explants. Multipotent progenitor cells thus exist in the pancreas of adult mice and can be activated cell autonomously to increase the functional beta cell mass by differentiation and proliferation rather than by self-duplication of pre-existing beta cells only.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18243096"},{"text":"The regenerative process of the pancreas is of interest because the main pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus is an inadequate number of insulin-producing \u03b2-cells.

Whether the gland is capable of cell regeneration after injury, in particular when suffered at adult age, is unknown. To investigate the adult pituitary's regenerative capacity and the response of its stem\/progenitor cell compartment to damage, we constructed a transgenic mouse model to conditionally destroy pituitary cells. GHCre\/iDTR mice express diphtheria toxin (DT) receptor after transcriptional activation by Cre recombinase, which is driven by the GH promoter. Treatment with DT for 3 d leads to gradual GH(+) (somatotrope) cell obliteration with a final ablation grade of 80-90% 1 wk later. The stem\/progenitor cell-clustering side population promptly expands after injury, concordant with the immediate increase in Sox2(+) stem\/progenitor cells. In addition, folliculo-stellate cells, previously designated as pituitary stem\/progenitor cells and significantly overlapping with Sox2(+) cells, also increase in abundance. In situ examination reveals expansion of the Sox2(+) marginal-zone niche and appearance of remarkable Sox2(+) cells that contain GH. When mice are left after the DT-provoked lesion, GH(+) cells considerably regenerate during the following months. Double Sox2(+)\/GH(+) cells are observed throughout the regenerative period, suggesting recovery of somatotropes from stem\/progenitor cells, as further supported by 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) pulse-chase lineage tracing.

Immature pancreatic precursor cells were transplanted into immunodeficient mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes, and glycemia was initially controlled with exogenous insulin.

Such mechanisms might entail an increase in GH-secretory burst frequency, amplitude, or duration, heightened interpulse basal GH release, or a prolonged half-life of GH. These mechanisms can be distinguished by deconvolution analysis of appropriate GH time series. Earlier studies employed RIA or IRMA with sensitivities of 0.1-0.5 microgram\/L, which result in frequently undetectable serum GH concentrations. To address these limitations, we undertook blood sampling at 10-min intervals for 24 h and applied a high-sensitivity immunofluorometric assay of GH (sensitivity 0.0115 microgram\/L). Multiparameter deconvolution analysis was used to estimate specific features of GH secretion, while simultaneously calculating the half-life of endogenous GH. Eleven men and 11 premenopausal women from the same community were studied. Discrete peak detection by Cluster was employed as a complementary half-life-independent technique to assign variations in serum GH into pulsatile and basal fractions over 24 h. Cluster revealed significantly higher mean serum GH concentrations over 24 h in women (0.78 +\/- 0.08 microgram\/L) compared with in men (0.27 +\/- 0.03 microgram\/L, P < 0.00005). Women exhibited significantly higher maximal serum GH concentration peak values than men (2.08 +\/- 0.34 microgram\/L in women, 0.67 +\/- 0.11 microgram\/L in men, P = 0.0008), which could be, in turn, attributed to a significantly increased incremental serum GH peak amplitude (1.85 +\/- 0.33 microgram\/L in women vs. 0.60 +\/- 0.10 microgram\/L in men, P = 0.0021) and a longer peak duration (114 +\/- 8 min in women, 86 +\/- 4 min in men, P = 0.008). The mean area under the serum GH concentration peak was significantly (3-fold) higher in women than in men (98 +\/- 17 micrograms\/L.min in women, 34 +\/- 8 micrograms\/L.min in men, P = 0.0046). Serum GH peak frequency was similar in women (9.7 +\/- 0.8 peak\/24 h) and men (10.7 +\/- 1.1 peak\/24 h, P = NS). The mechanisms underlying the increase in serum GH concentration pulse amplitude, duration, and area were investigated further by deconvolution analysis. Deconvolution analysis disclosed equivalent secretory pulse frequencies in women and men (13 +\/- 0.9 bursts\/day in women, 10.5 +\/- 1.3 bursts\/day in men,P = NS), and statistically indistinguishable mean interburst intervals of 106 +\/- 8 min in women and 150 +\/- 26 min in men (P = NS). GH-secretory burst mass was significantly higher in women by approximately 2.4-fold (P = 0.0013) compared with in men, which was attributed to a greater burst amplitude. Only low levels of basal GH release were inferred in women (5%) and men (9%), which did not differ significantly between genders. Moreover, the calculated half-life of endogenous GH was no different in women compared with in men: 15.8 +\/- 0.7 min vs. 17.1 +\/- 0.8 min, respectively (P = NS). The calculated daily secretion rate was 3-fold higher in women (47 +\/- 4.8 micrograms\/L.24 h) than in men (15 +\/- 1.8 micrograms\/L.24 h) (P < 0.001). In summary, discrete peak-detection analysis of serum GH concentration profiles collected at 10-min intervals over 24 h in men and premenopausal women discloses significantly different mean serum GH concentrations that are accounted for by higher maximal and incremental serum GH peak amplitudes. Deconvolution analysis demonstrated that the mechanism supporting the amplitude-specific difference in women was an augmentation of the GH-secretory burst mass caused by a higher GH-secretory burst amplitude. These gender differences were highly specific because the frequency of detectable GH-secretory bursts, the calculated endogenous half-life, and the estimated basal GH release were no different in women than in men.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8675561"},{"text":"The aim of this study was to assess the relative influence on the 24-h aldosterone profile of the adrenocorticotropic system, primarily modulated by a circadian rhythmicity, and the renin-angiotensin system, which is influenced by sleep.

We examined patterns of association when accounting for multiple SNPs at a locus and when including additional SNPs from the 1000 Genomes Project. We identified 1298 cis-eQTLs at an approximate false discovery rate 0.01, of which 118 (9%) showed evidence of a second independent signal. For this subset of 118 traits, accounting for two signals resulted in an average 31% increase in phenotypic variance explained (Wilcoxon P< 0.0001). The association of SNPs with cis gene expression could increase, stay similar or decrease in significance when accounting for linkage disequilibrium with second signals at the same locus. Pairs of SNPs increasing in significance tended to have gene expression increasing alleles on opposite haplotypes, whereas pairs of SNPs decreasing in significance tended to have gene expression increasing alleles on the same haplotypes. Adding data from the 1000 Genomes Project showed that apparently independent signals could be potentially explained by a single association signal.

The results support the hypothesis that vitellogenin is a true storage protein that is utilized for various metabolic purposes including the synthesis of brood food.

We tested the prediction by planting seeds from 17 species ranging in weight from 0.1 to 100\u2009mg at a variety of depths in a sand medium. The species were spread across 16 genera and 13 families, all occurring in fire-prone fynbos shrublands of South Africa. Maximum emergence depth was found to scale allometrically with seed weight with an exponent of 0.334, close to the predicted value. We used the allometry to predict recruitment response to experimentally simulated variation in fire intensity. Five species with small (<2\u2009mg) seeds and five with large (>10\u2009mg) seeds were planted at \u226420-mm and 40-mm depths and exposed to low and high heat treatments and a control. The allometric equation predicted that species with large seeds would be able to emerge from a depth of 40\u2009mm but those with small seeds would not. Only 1% of 481 seedlings from small-seeded species emerged from the 40-mm planting compared with 40% of 626 seedlings from the large-seeded group. The simulated fire treatments killed seeds in shallow, but not deeper, soil layers. At simulated high fire intensities, seedling emergence was poor in small-seeded species but good in large-seeded species, with most seedlings emerging from the 40-mm planting depth. Seed size could be a useful general predictor of recruitment success under different fire intensities in this system. We suggest that allometric relationships in plants deserve wider attention as predictive tools.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28308044"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28308044"],"type":"factoid","exact_answer":"scale as the cube root of seed weight","ideal_answer":"geometric model predicting that maximum seedling emergence depth should scale as the cube root of seed weight"}

Cancer genomes are highly rearranged and are characterized by complex translocations and regional copy number alterations that target loci harboring cancer-relevant genes. Efforts to uncover the underlying mechanisms driving genome instability in cancer have revealed a prominent role for telomeres. Telomeres are nucleoprotein structures that protect the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes and are particularly vulnerable due to progressive shortening during each round of DNA replication and, thus, a lifetime of tissue renewal places the organism at risk for increasing chromosomal instability. Indeed, telomere erosion has been documented in aging tissues and hyperproliferative disease states-conditions strongly associated with increased cancer risk. Telomere dysfunction can produce the opposing pathophysiological states of degenerative aging or cancer with the specific outcome dictated by the integrity of DNA damage checkpoint responses. In most advanced cancers, telomerase is reactivated and serves to maintain telomere length and emerging data have also documented the capacity of telomerase to directly regulate cancer-promoting pathways.

In the present study, we found that mature erythrocytes contain considerable amounts of caspase-3 and -8, whereas essential components of the mitochondrial apoptotic cascade such as caspase-9, Apaf-1 and cytochrome c were missing. Strikingly, although caspases of erythrocytes were functionally active in vitro, they failed to become activated in intact erythrocytes either during prolonged storage or in response to various proapoptotic stimuli. Following an increase of cytosolic calcium, instead the cysteine protease calpain but not caspases became activated and mediated fodrin cleavage and other morphological alterations such as cell shrinkage.

Exposed phosphatidylserine is recognized by macrophages that engulf and degrade the affected cells. Eryptosis is triggered by erythrocyte injury after several stressors, including oxidative stress. Besides caspase activation after oxidative stress, two signaling pathways converge to trigger eryptosis: (a) formation of prostaglandin E(2) leads to activation of Ca(2+)-permeable cation channels, and (b) the phospholipase A(2)-mediated release of platelet-activating factor activates a sphingomyelinase, leading to formation of ceramide. Increased cytosolic Ca(2+) activity and enhanced ceramide levels lead to membrane scrambling with subsequent phosphatidylserine exposure. Moreover, Ca(2+) activates Ca(2+)-sensitive K(2+) channels, leading to cellular KCl loss and cell shrinkage. In addition, Ca(2+) stimulates the protease calpain, resulting in degradation of the cytoskeleton. Eryptosis is inhibited by erythropoietin, which thus extends the life span of circulating erythrocytes. Eryptosis may be a mechanism of defective erythrocytes to escape hemolysis.

The exception is 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (EC 2.3.1.16) whose specific activity in brain mitochondria is 125 times lower than in heart mitochondria.

{"body":"Why insects are so energy-efficient while flying?","snippets":[{"text":"1. Flight by insects is characterized by the most intense respiration known in biology and also the most controlled. Thus insect flight muscle may be the tissue of choice for the study of biochemical adaptation in the control of catabolism and biological oxidations, and many of the results obtained with insects have a significance and a relevance that transcend the boundaries between classes. In insects, such as the blowfly, flight is distinguished additionally by high wingbeat frequencies and an asynchronous type of excitation-contraction coupling. In spite of this intense muscular work, metabolic processes are not limited by the availability of oxygen. Also of importance is the morphological organization of the flight muscle and mitochondria, which have evolved ultrastructurally and biochemically into an effective catabolic machine. 2. In the fly, carbohydrate, principally glycogen, is the sole metabolic fuel; fats are not used in flight and enzymes concerned with fatty acid utilization are virtually lacking. Glycogenolysis does not lead to lactic acid; instead, the end products of glycolysis are pyruvate and alpha-glycerophosphate. The alpha-glycerophosphate cycle provides a mechanism not only for the reoxidation of glycolytically produced NADH but also for the stoicheiometric formation from each molecule of hexose equivalent of two molecules of pyruvate, which are then available for oxidation via the tricarboxylate cycle. The absence of dicarboxylate and tricarboxylate carriers from the mitochondria ensures that tricarboxylate-cycle intermediates do not exit from the mitochondrion but that pyruvate is oxidized to completion. On initiation of flight, mitochondrial oxidation of pyruvate is impeded by the lack of tricarboxylate-cycle intermediates for the generation of oxaloacetate. This is circumvented by the oxidation of proline. 3. The controls on metabolism in flight muscle, i.e. (1) glycogenolysis at phosphorylase and phosphorylase kinase, (2) glycolysis at phosphofructokinase, (3) alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, (4) proline dehydrogenase and (5) tricarboxylate cycle at isocitrate dehydrogenase, are effected by the phosphate potential and\/or Ca2+.

These metabolites are potent activators of glycogen phosphorylase and phosphofructokinase (PFK). Activation of glycolysis by AMP and Pi is reinforced synergistically by fructose 2,6-biphosphate (F2,6P2), a very potent activator of PFK. During prolonged flight locusts gradually change from using carbohydrate to lipids as their main fuel. This requires a decrease in glycolytic flux which is brought about, at least in part, by a marked decrease in the content of F2,6P2 in flight muscle (by 80% within 15 min of flight). The synthesis of F2,6P2 in flight muscle can be stimulated by the nervous system via the biogenic amine octopamine.

Several analyses have appeared of two distinct models with n additive polygenic loci subject to mutation and stabilizing selection. Each is reviewed and a new analysis and model are presented. Lande and Fleming analyzed extensions of a model originally treated by Kimura which assumes a continuum of possible allelic effects at each locus. Latter and Bulmer analyzed a model with diallelic loci. The published analyses of these models lead to qualitatively different predictions concerning the dependence of the equilibrium genetic variance on the underlying biological parameters. A new asymptotic analysis of the Kimura model shows that the different predictions are not consequences of the number of alleles assumed but rather are attributable to assumptions concerning the relative magnitudes of per locus mutation rates, the phenotypic effects of mutation, and the intensity of selection. This conclusion is reinforced by analysis of a model with triallelic loci. None of the approximate analyses presented are mathematically rigorous. To quantify their accuracy and display the domains of validity for alternative approximations, numerically determined equilibria are presented. In addition, empirical estimates of mutation rates and selection intensity are reviewed, revealing weaknesses in both the data and its connection to the models.

Most studies with respect to evolution and phylogeny in sponges have been performed with the marine demosponges Suberites domuncula and Geodia cydonium. These animals possess effective defense systems against microbes and parasites which involve engulfment of bacteria into specific cells, but also signal transduction pathways which actively kill bacteria. Among those is the LPS-mediated pathway, with the stress-responsive kinases. In addition, sponges are provided with an interferon-related system, with the (2-5)A synthetase as controlling enzyme. Transplantation studies have been performed on tissue, as well as at the cellular level (\"mixed sponge cell reaction assay\") which demonstrate the complex molecular strategy by which sponges respond to allogeneic- and\/or autogeneic signals. Among the molecules involved in histo(in)compatibility response of sponges, cytokines e.g., the allograft inflammatory factor 1, have been identified which control rejection of allografts.

Traditionally, aging was thought to change the properties of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). We discuss here a new model of stem cell aging that challenges this view. It is now well-established that the HSC compartment is heterogeneous, consisting of epigenetically fixed subpopulations of HSC that differ in self-renewal and differentiation capacity. New data show that the representation of these HSC subsets changes during aging. HSC that generate lymphocyte-rich progeny are depleted, while myeloid-biased HSC are enriched in the aged HSC compartment. Myeloid-biased HSC, even when isolated from young donors, have most of the characteristics that had been attributed to aged HSC. Thus, the distinct behavior of the HSC isolated from aged hosts is due to the accumulation of myeloid-biased HSC. By extension this means that the properties of individual HSC are not substantially changed during the lifespan of the organism and that aged hosts do not contain many aged HSC. Myeloid-biased HSC give rise to mature cells slowly but contribute for a long time to peripheral hematopoiesis. We propose that such slow, \"lazy\" HSC are less likely to be transformed and therefore may safely sustain hematopoiesis for a long time.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19066464"},{"text":"Telomerase activity controls telomere length and plays a pivotal role in stem cells, aging, and cancer.

This study included only articles dealing with atmospheric pollutants resulting primarily from vehicle emissions. Three researchers were involved in the final selection of the studies, and the chosen articles were approved by at least two of the three researchers. Of the 84 non-Brazilian studies analyzed, 80 showed an association between atmospheric pollution and adverse effects on human health. Moreover, 66 showed evidence of adverse effects on human health, even at levels below the permitted emission standards. Three studies mentioned public policies aimed at changing emission standards. Similarly, the 29 selected Brazilian studies reported adverse associations with human health, and 27 showed evidence of adverse effects even at levels below the legally permitted emission standards. Of these studies, 16 mentioned public policies aimed at changing emission standards. Based on the Brazilian and non-Brazilian scientific studies that have been conducted, it can be concluded that, even under conditions that are compliant with Brazilian air quality standards, the concentration of atmospheric pollutants in Brazil can negatively affect human health. However, as little discussion of this topic has been generated, this finding demonstrates the need to incorporate epidemiological evidence into decisions regarding legal regulations and to discuss the public policy implications in epidemiological studies.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21655765"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21655765"],"type":"not_usable","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":""}

A sharp boundary between an outer shell of bound high-affinity antibody and an inner antibody-free core has been previously observed and mathematically modeled and was termed the \"binding site barrier.\" We show here that this process is well described by a simplified shrinking core model wherein binding equilibration is much more rapid than diffusion. This analysis provides the following experimentally testable predictions: (a) the binding site barrier is a moving boundary whose velocity is proportional to the time integral of antibody concentration at the spheroid surface (i.e. plasma antibody AUC); (b) the velocity of this moving boundary is independent of binding affinity, if the affinity is sufficiently high to strongly favor antibody\/antigen complex formation at prevailing antibody concentrations; and (c) maximum tumor retention is achieved when the antibody\/antigen dissociation rate approaches the rate of antigen metabolic turnover. The consistency of these predictions with published experimental results is demonstrated. The shrinking core model provides a simple analytic relationship predicting the effects of altered antibody pharmacokinetics, antibody molecular weight, antigen turnover rate, antigen expression level, and micrometastasis size on antibody penetration and retention. For example, a formula is provided for predicting the bolus dose necessary to accomplish tumor saturation as a function of antibody and tumor properties.

The quantitative contribution of different cellular reactions to these processes is assessed in mammals. We estimate that approximately 90% of mammalian oxygen consumption in the standard state is mitochondrial, of which approximately 20% is uncoupled by the mitochondrial proton leak and 80% is coupled to ATP synthesis. The consequences of the significant contribution of proton leak to standard metabolic rate for tissue P-to-O ratio, heat production, and free energy dissipation by oxidative phosphorylation and the estimated contribution of ATP-consuming processes to tissue oxygen consumption rate are discussed. Of the 80% of oxygen consumption coupled to ATP synthesis, approximately 25-30% is used by protein synthesis, 19-28% by the Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase, 4-8% by the Ca2(+)-ATPase, 2-8% by the actinomyosin ATPase, 7-10% by gluconeogenesis, and 3% by ureagenesis, with mRNA synthesis and substrate cycling also making significant contributions. The main cellular reactions that uncouple standard energy metabolism are the Na+, K+, H+, and Ca2+ channels and leaks of cell membranes and protein breakdown. Cellular metabolic rate is controlled by a number of processes including metabolic demand and substrate supply. The differences in standard metabolic rate between animals of different body mass and phylogeny appear to be due to proportionate changes in the whole of energy metabolism. Heat is produced by some reactions and taken up by others but is mainly produced by the reactions of mitochondrial respiration, oxidative phosphorylation, and proton leak on the inner mitochondrial membrane.

The mutations were detected in a subsequent bioassay step, which involved transformation of an indicator strain with the plasmid DNA that was retrieved from the reaction mixture, followed by plating on lactose\/MacConkey plates. UV mutations produced in this cell-free reaction required the recA and umuC gene products and were prevented by rifampicin, an inhibitor of RNA polymerase, which inhibited plasmid replication. Removal of pyrimidine photodimers from the plasmid by enzymatic photoreactivation after the in vitro stage, but prior to transformation, increased plasmid survival as expected. Surprisingly, it also caused a large increase in the frequency of UV mutations detected in the bioassay. This photoreactivation-stimulated in vitro UV mutagenesis was dependent on the excision repair genes uvrA, uvrB, and uvrC and occurred in the absence of DNA replication. This suggests that two distinct UV mutagenesis pathways occurred in vitro: a replication-dependent pathway (type I) and a repair-dependent pathway (type II). DNA sequence analysis of type II UV mutations revealed a spectrum similar to that of in vivo UV mutagenesis. When the photoreactivation step was included in the protocol, type II UV mutagenesis did not require the RecA and UmuC proteins. These results are in agreement with the in vivo delayed photoreactivation phenomenon, where the removal of photodimers after an incubation period eliminated the requirement for RecA and UmuC in UV mutagenesis. The above system will enable the biochemical analysis of UV mutagenesis and the isolation of proteins involved in the process.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1314385"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1314385"],"type":"not_usable","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":""}

This finding is consistent with the proposed role of AMP and the adenylate kinase reaction in the regulation of glycolysis. However, in the flight muscle of the honey-bee the ATP\/AMP ratio is very low, so that glycolysis may be regulated by factors other than the variation in AMP concentration.

We suggest that this is because in aged normal individuals, there is a lesser production and\/or greater removal of beta-amyloid (Abeta), so that less of the viral DNA is seen to be associated with Abeta in the brain. Our present data, together with our finding of Abeta accumulation in herpes simplex virus type 1-infected cells and mouse brain, suggest that this virus is a major cause of amyloid plaques and hence probably a significant aetiological factor in Alzheimer's disease.

The larger apparent relative molecular mass (Mr) of A68, compared to normal human tau, was attributed to abnormal phosphorylation of A68 because enzymatic dephosphorylation of A68 reduced its Mr to close to that of normal tau. Moreover, the LysSerProVal motif in normal human tau appeared to be an abnormal phosphorylation site in A68 because the Ser in this motif was a phosphate acceptor site in A68, but not in normal human tau.

Although the long-held view that aging involves neurocognitive impairment is now dismissed, aging is a major risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer;s disease, Parkinson;s disease and Huntington's disease, among others. There are many age-related changes affecting the brain, contributing both to certain declining in function and increased frailty, which could singly and collectively affect neuronal viability and vulnerability. Among those changes, both inflammatory responses in aged brains and the altered regulation of toll like receptors, which appears to be relevant for understanding susceptibility to neurodegenerative processes, are linked to pathogenic mechanisms of several diseases. Here, we review how aging and pro-inflammatory environment could modulate microglial phenotype and its reactivity and contribute to the genesis of neurodegenerative processes. Data support our idea that age-related microglial cell changes, by inducing cytotoxicity in contrast to neuroprotection, could contribute to the onset of neurodegenerative changes. This view can have important implications for the development of new therapeutic approaches.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20002526"},{"text":"Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prominent cause of senile dementia, is clinically characterized by the extracellular deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta) and the intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. It has been well accepted that AD pathogenesis arises from perturbation in the homeostasis of Abeta in the brain. Abeta is normally produced at high levels in the brain and cleared in an equivalent rate. Thus, even a moderate decrease in the clearance leads to the accumulation of Abeta and subsequent amyloid deposition. Microglia are the tissue macrophages in the central nervous system (CNS) and have been shown to play major roles in internalization and degradation of Abeta. Abeta exists in the brain both in soluble and in fibrillar forms. Microglia interact with these two forms of Abeta in different ways. They take up soluble forms of Abeta through macropinocytosis and LDL receptor-related proteins (LRPs) mediated pathway. Fibrillar forms of Abeta interact with the cell surface innate immune receptor complex, initiating intracellular signaling cascades that stimulate phagocytosis. Inflammatory responses influence the activation status of microglia and subsequently regulate their ability to take up and degrade Abeta. ApoE and its receptors have been shown to play critical roles in these processes. In this review, we will explore the mechanisms that microglia utilize to clear Abeta and the effectors that modulate the processes.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20552234"},{"text":"The paired helical filament, the principal constituent of the neurofibrillary tangles characteristic of Alzheimer disease, is shown to consist of two structurally distinct parts.

Our study is based on the premise that avian USWS serves a predator detection function, since the eye contralateral to the awake hemisphere remains open during USWS. If USWS functions as a form of predator detection, then birds should be able to control both the proportion of slow-wave sleep composed of USWS and the orientation of the open eye in response to changes in predation risk. To test these predictions we recorded eye state and the EEG of mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) sleeping in groups of four birds arranged in a row. Birds at the ends of the row were more exposed than those in the central positions, who were flanked on both sides by other birds, and thus should perceive a greater risk of predation. Consistent with a predator detection function, when compared to birds in the group's center, birds at the exposed ends of the row showed a 150% increase in USWS and a preference for directing the open eye away from the group, the direction from which a predator is most likely to approach. Furthermore, during USWS mallards responded rapidly to threatening visual stimuli presented to the open eye. This ability to facultatively control sleep and wakefulness simultaneously in different regions of the brain probably involves the neuroanatomical interhemispheric separation responsible for independent hemispheric functioning during wakefulness in birds.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10563490"},{"text":"Unihemispheric sleep has been observed in numerous species, including birds and aquatic mammals.

Here, unihemispheric sleep is simulated using a physiologically based quantitative model of the mammalian ascending arousal system. The model includes mutual inhibition between wake-promoting monoaminergic nuclei (MA) and sleep-promoting ventrolateral preoptic nuclei (VLPO), driven by circadian and homeostatic drives as well as cholinergic and orexinergic input to MA. The model is extended here to incorporate two distinct hemispheres and their interconnections. It is postulated that inhibitory connections between VLPO nuclei in opposite hemispheres are responsible for unihemispheric sleep, and it is shown that contralateral inhibitory connections promote unihemispheric sleep while ipsilateral inhibitory connections promote bihemispheric sleep. The frequency of alternating unihemispheric sleep bouts is chiefly determined by sleep homeostasis and its corresponding time constant. It is shown that the model reproduces dolphin sleep, and that the sleep regimes of humans, cetaceans, and fur seals, the latter both terrestrially and in a marine environment, require only modest changes in contralateral connection strength and homeostatic time constant. It is further demonstrated that fur seals can potentially switch between their terrestrial bihemispheric and aquatic unihemispheric sleep patterns by varying just the contralateral connection strength.

This is a cofactor of extraordinary versatility, playing roles in methyl group transfer, 5'-deoxyadenosyl group transfer, polyamine synthesis, ethylene synthesis in plants, and many others. In animals, the great bulk of S-adenosylmethionine is used in methylation reactions. S-Adenosylhomocysteine, which is a product of these methyltransferases, gives rise to homocysteine. Homocysteine may be remethylated to methionine or converted to cysteine by the transsulfuration pathway. Methionine may also be metabolized by a transamination pathway.

Cysteine desulfuration is accomplished by alternate reactions catalyzed by cystathionine \u03b2-synthase and cystathionine \u03b3-lyase. Cysteine is also catabolized by pathways that require the initial oxidation of the cysteine thiol by cysteine dioxygenase to form cysteinesulfinate. The oxidative pathway leads to production of taurine and sulfate in a ratio of approximately 2:1. Relative metabolism of cysteine by desulfuration versus oxidative pathways is influenced by cysteine dioxygenase activity, which is low in animals fed low-protein diets and high in animals fed excess sulfur amino acids. Thus, desulfuration reactions dominate when cysteine is deficient, whereas oxidative catabolism dominates when cysteine is in excess. In rats consuming a diet with an adequate level of sulfur amino acids, about two thirds of cysteine catabolism occurs by oxidative pathways and one third by desulfuration pathways. Cysteine dioxygenase is robustly regulated in response to cysteine availability and may function to provide a pathway to siphon cysteine to less toxic metabolites than those produced by cysteine desulfuration reactions.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20162368"},{"text":"Homocysteine, a cardiovascular and neurocognitive disease risk factor, is converted to hydrogen sulfide, a cardiovascular and neuronal protectant, through the transsulfuration pathway.

Here we show that the transsulfuration enzymes, cystathionine \u03b2-synthase and cystathionine \u03b3-lyase, are secreted by microvascular endothelial cells and hepatocytes, circulate as members of the plasma proteome, and actively produce hydrogen sulfide from homocysteine in human blood. We further demonstrate that extracellular transsulfuration regulates cell function when the endothelium is challenged with homocysteine and that hydrogen sulfide protects the endothelium from serum starvation and from hypoxia-reoxygenation injury.

The aim of this study was to identify recurrent focal chromosomal aberrations and their candidate driver genes in a well-defined series of stage II colon cancers and assess their potential clinical relevance. High-resolution DNA copy number profiles were obtained from 38 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded colon cancer samples with matched normal mucosa as a reference using array comparative genomic hybridization. In total, 81 focal chromosomal aberrations were identified that harboured 177 genes. Statistical validation of focal aberrations and identification of candidate driver genes were performed by enrichment analysis and mapping copy number and mutation data of colorectal, breast, and pancreatic cancer and glioblastomas to loci of focal aberrations in stage II colon cancer. This analysis demonstrated a significant overlap with previously identified focal amplifications in colorectal cancer, but not with cancers from other sites. In contrast, focal deletions seemed less tumour type-specific since they also showed significant overlap with focal deletions of other sites. Focal deletions detected were significantly enriched for cancer genes and genes frequently mutated in colorectal cancer. The mRNA expression of these genes was significantly correlated with DNA copy number status, supporting the relevance of focal aberrations. Loss of 5q34 and gain of 13q22.1 were identified as independent prognostic factors of survival in this series of patients. In conclusion, focal chromosomal copy number aberrations in stage II colon cancer are enriched in cancer genes that contribute to and drive the process of colorectal cancer development.

Deletion of the p19(ARF), p53, or p21(WAF1) tumor suppressors but not p16(INK4a) prevented senescence and permitted tumorigenesis.

Although overexpression of Id1 in the mammary epithelium was not sufficient for tumorigenesis, mice with expression of both Id1 and activated Ras developed metastatic cancer. These tumors expressed high levels of p19(Arf), p53, and p21(Waf1), demonstrating that Id1 acts to make cells refractory to p21(Waf1)-dependent cell cycle arrest. Inactivation of the conditional Id1 allele in established tumors led to widespread senescence within 10 days, tumor growth arrest, and tumor regression in 40% of mice.

Moreover, lung adenomas initiated by endogenous levels of oncogenic K-Ras presented abundant senescent cells, but undetectable DNA damage signaling. Accordingly, K-Ras-driven adenomas were also senescent in Atm-null mice, and the tumorigenic progression of these lesions was only modestly accelerated by Atm-deficiency. Finally, we have examined chemically-induced fibrosarcomas, which possess a persistently activated DNA damage response and are highly sensitive to the activity of p53.

Here we combine theory and experiment to demonstrate that the promoter logic of pR - its measured activity as a function of LuxI and LuxR levels - contains all the biochemical information required to quantitatively predict the responses of such feedback loops. The interplay of promoter logic with feedback topology underlies the versatility of the LuxI\/LuxR paradigm: LuxR and LuxI positive-feedback systems show dramatically different responses, while a dual positive\/negative-feedback system displays synchronized oscillations. These results highlight the dual utility of promoter logic: to probe microscopic parameters and predict macroscopic phenotype.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22275861"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21690337","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22181189","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22275861"],"type":"summary","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":"Quorum sensing refers to the change in the cooperative behavior of a collection of elements in response to the change in their population size or density.

Heavy binge alcohol consumption over 11 mo dramatically and persistently decreased hippocampal proliferation and neurogenesis. Combinatorial analysis revealed distinct, actively dividing hippocampal neural progenitor cell types in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus that were in transition from stem-like radial glia-like cells (type 1) to immature transiently amplifying neuroblasts (type 2a, type 2b, and type 3), suggesting the evolutionary conservation of milestones of neuronal development in macaque monkeys. Alcohol significantly decreased the number of actively dividing type 1, 2a, and 2b cell types without significantly altering the early neuronal type 3 cells, suggesting that alcohol interferes with the division and migration of hippocampal preneuronal progenitors. Furthermore, the lasting alcohol-induced reduction in hippocampal neurogenesis paralleled an increase in neural degeneration mediated by nonapoptotic pathways. Altogether, these results demonstrate that the hippocampal neurogenic niche during adolescence is highly vulnerable to alcohol and that alcohol decreases neuronal turnover in adolescent nonhuman primate hippocampus by altering the ongoing process of neuronal development.

Cell cycle distribution was measured using a combination of markers (Ki-67, bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, and phosphohistone H3) to determine the proportion of NPCs within G1, S, and G2\/M phases of the cell cycle. Cell cycle kinetics were calculated using a cumulative bromodeoxyuridine injection protocol to determine the effect of alcohol on cell cycle length and S-phase duration. Binge alcohol exposure reduced the proportion of NPCs in S-phase, but had no effect on G1 or G2\/M phases, indicating that alcohol specifically targets S-phase of the cell cycle.

This \"protective barrier\" against the systemic effects of ethanol disappears after gastrectomy and is partly lost in the alcoholic because of accelerated gastric emptying and decreased gastric ADH activity, respectively.

Effects at higher ethanol dosage are still the subject of controversy. However, not all subjects display significant FPM, and published negative reports with H2 blockers do not specify whether first pass metabolism was present to begin with; some of the negative investigations also used dilute concentrations of alcohol, shown to minimize gastric metabolism.

These data are compatible with the concept that hemoglobin can interfere with melatonin determinations by competing for melatonin and the iodinated tracer. Unlike melatonin receptor binding, the binding of 125I-melatonin to hemoglobin was not inhibited by guanine nucleotide analogs (i.e., GTP gamma S, GTP beta S, and Gpp(NH)p). Sodium cyanide had no effect on 125I-melatonin binding, indicating that 125I-melatonin does not bind to the heme group. On the other hand, 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, at physiological concentrations (3-4 mM), decreased the apparent Bmax and Kd of 125I-melatonin binding to hemoglobin. These data suggest that 125I-melatonin binding to hemoglobin is conformation-specific and is unfavorable in the deoxyhemoglobin state.

The disease has proven difficult to control in the cattle population and the Eurasian badger (Meles meles) is a source of infection.

Here we review the potential routes of bTB transmission between badgers and cattle and explore the options for managing cattle and badger behaviour with a view to reducing the risks of inter-species transmission at pasture and within farm buildings. We discuss the relative merits of different cattle grazing regimes, habitat manipulations and badger latrine management in reducing the potential for badger-cattle contact at pasture. The physical exclusion of badgers from farm buildings is suggested as the simplest, and potentially most effective, method of reducing contact and opportunities for disease transmission between badgers and cattle.

As part of national programmes to control tuberculosis in livestock, considerable effort has been devoted to studying the disease in badgers and this has lead to a rapid increase in our knowledge of tuberculosis in this host. Tuberculosis in badgers is a chronic infection and in a naturally-infected population the severity of disease can vary widely, from latent infection (infection without clinical signs and no visible lesions) to severe disease with generalized pathology. The high prevalence of pulmonary infection strongly supports the lungs as the principal site of primary infection and that inhalation of infectious aerosol particles is the principal mode of transmission. However, other routes, including transmission via infected bite wounds, are known to occur. The ante-mortem diagnosis of infection is difficult to achieve, as clinical examination and immunological and bacteriological examination of clinical samples are insensitive diagnostic procedures. Because infection in the majority of badgers is latent, the gross post-mortem diagnosis is also insensitive. A definitive diagnosis can only be made by the isolation of M. bovis. However, to gain a high level of sensitivity in the bacteriological examination, a large number of tissues from each badger must be cultured and sensitive culture methods employed. The transmission and maintenance of M. bovis in badger populations are complex processes where many factors influence within-population prevalence and rates of transmission. Badger social structures and the longevity of infected animals make them an ideal maintenance host for M. bovis infection. Badgers are directly implicated in the transmission of infection to cattle and the inability to eradicate the disease from cattle is, in part, a consequence of the interactions between the two species. A detailed understanding and knowledge of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of the disease are recognized as fundamental for devising new strategies to control infection with a view to limiting interspecies transmission. Vaccination, in spite of formidable challenges, is seen as the best long-term strategy option and studies with captive badgers have shown that vaccination with M. bovis bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) induces protection when delivered by a variety of routes. Continued research is required to develop effective technologies to control the disease both in badgers and cattle. A combination of strategies, which employ the optimal use and targeting of resources, is likely to make a significant contribution towards eradication of the disease.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21131004"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19846226","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21131004"],"type":"yesno","exact_answer":"yes","ideal_answer":"The physical exclusion of badgers from farm buildings is suggested as the simplest, and potentially most effective, method of reducing contact and opportunities for disease transmission between badgers and cattle"}

A short 30 min exposure to 0.5 mM DADS followed by removal induced 70% cell death (50% necrotic, 20% apoptotic) within 2 h, increasing to 75% after 4 h. The early intracellular events associated with DADS-induced cell death were monitored with two-photon fluorescence microscopy to track mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsi(m)), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and NADH or reduced glutathione (GSH) under aerobic conditions. DADS treatment decreased intracellular GSH and elevated intracellular ROS levels. Additionally, DADS induced a marked decrease of Deltapsi(m) and lowered respiration in cell suspensions and isolated mitochondria. In vitro kinetic experiments in cell-free extracts suggest that glutathione-S-transferase (GST) is one of the intracellular targets of DADS. Additional targets were also identified, including inhibition of a site or sites between complexes II-IV in the electron transport chain, as well as the mitochondrial ATP-synthase.

Sleep disruption is common in patients with cough and is often the reason why they seek medical attention. Sleep suppresses cough and the biological mechanisms for this action are poorly understood. Cough has recently been reported as a presenting symptom of obstructive sleep apnea. It is uncommon for healthy people to cough at night; however, approximately 50% of patients with chronic cough report sleep disruption due to cough. Cough frequency is much lower at night than during the day. There is reduced exposure to tussive stimuli at night and decreased cough reflex sensitivity. Cough is more difficult to induce in REM sleep compared to slow-wave sleep. Studies of anesthetized humans have shown that the cough reflex is suppressed; however, the expiratory reflex is less affected. The sleep-cough interaction has implications for the physician. The measurement of cough frequency with 24-h ambulatory cough monitors in patients with chronic cough suggests that the presence or absence of nocturnal cough is not helpful in establishing the etiology. Nocturnal cough may be a useful outcome parameter for clinical trials of antitussive drugs since it is under less voluntary control than daytime cough. Most antitussive drugs are sedatives. This suggests that part or all of their action may be through an effect on cortical neural pathways. Unexplained chronic cough has recently been reported as a presenting feature of obstructive sleep apnea. Patients are likely to be female and report gastroesophageal reflux and rhinitis.

This study identifies an additional central barrier to HGT-the lack of co-adaptation between the codon usage of the transferred gene and the tRNA pool of the recipient organism. Analyzing the genomic sequences of more than 190 microorganisms and the HGT events that have occurred between them, we show that the number of genes that were horizontally transferred between organisms is positively correlated with the similarity between their tRNA pools. Those genes that are better adapted to the tRNA pools of the target genomes tend to undergo more frequent HGT. At the community (or environment) level, organisms that share a common ecological niche tend to have similar tRNA pools. These results remain significant after controlling for diverse ecological and evolutionary parameters. Our analysis demonstrates that there are bi-directional associations between the similarity in the tRNA pools of organisms and the number of HGT events occurring between them. Similar tRNA pools between a donor and a host tend to increase the probability that a horizontally acquired gene will become fixed in its new genome.

In the last couple of years, remarkable progress has been made toward understanding the underlying mechanism in mammals. Indeed, the discovery of the SECIS RNA binding protein SBP2, which is not a translation factor, paved the way for the subsequent isolation of mSelB\/EFSec, the mammalian homolog of SelB. In contrast to the eubacterial SelB, the specialized elongation factor mSelB\/EFSec the SECIS RNA binding function. The role is carried out by SBP2 that also forms a protein-protein complex with mSelB\/EFSec. As a consequence, an important difference between the eubacterial and eukaryal selenoprotein synthesis machineries is that the functions of SelB are divided into two proteins in eukaryotes. Obviously, selenoprotein synthesis represents a higher degree of complexity than anticipated, and more needs to be discovered in eukaryotes. In this review, we will focus on the structural and functional aspects of the SelB and SBP2 factors in selenoprotein synthesis.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12370018"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12370018"],"type":"not_usable","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":""}

To understand this regulatory mechanism, we conducted a large-scale analysis of the currently available data and examined how the overlapping arrangements of cis-NATs affect their expression level. Here, we show that for both human and mouse the expression level of cis-NATs decreases as the length of the overlapping region increases. In particular, the proportions of the highly expressed cis-NATs in all cis-NATs examined were approximately 36 and 47% for human and mouse, respectively, when the overlapping region was <200 bp. However, both proportions decreased to virtually zero when the overlapping regions were >2000 bp in length.

Now, there are an increasing number of reports of bacterial proteins that are glycosylated. Pilin of pathogenic Neisseria is one of the best characterised post-translationally modified bacterial proteins, with four different types of modifications reported, including a novel glycosylation. Pilin monomers assemble to form pilus fibres, which are long protein filaments that protrude from the surface of bacterial cells and are key virulence factors. To aid in the investigation of these modifications, pure pilin is required. A number of pilin purification methods have been published, but none are appropriate for the routine purification of pilin from many different isolates. This study describes a novel, rapid, and simple method of pilin purification from Neisseria meningitidis C311#3, which facilitates the production of consistent quantities of pure, native pilin. A 6x histidine tag was fused to the C-terminus of the pilin subunit structural gene, pilE, via homologous recombination placing the 6x histidine-tagged allele in the chromosome of N. meningitidis C311#3. Pilin was purified under non-denaturing conditions via a two-step process using immobilised metal affinity chromatography (IMAC), followed by dye affinity chromatography. Analysis of the purified pilin confirmed that it retained both of the post-translational modifications examined.

Biochemical studies of molluscan shell colour were fairly common in the last century, but few of these studies have been confirmed using modern methods and very few shell pigments have been fully characterised. Here, we use modern chemical and multi-modal spectroscopic techniques to identify two porphyrin pigments and eumelanin in the shell of marine snails Clanculus pharaonius and C margaritarius. The same porphyrins were also identified in coloured foot tissue of both species. We use high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to show definitively that these porphyrins are uroporphyrin I and uroporphyrin III. Evidence from confocal microscopy analyses shows that the distribution of porphyrin pigments corresponds to the striking pink-red of C. pharaonius shells, as well as pink-red dots and lines on the early whorls of C. margaritarius and yellow-brown colour of later whorls. Additional HPLC results suggest that eumelanin is likely responsible for black spots. We refer to the two differently coloured porphyrin pigments as trochopuniceus (pink-red) and trochoxouthos (yellow-brown) in order to distinguish between them.

We screened 70 variants from across CD36 for an association with severe malaria phenotypes, employing a case-control study of 1350 subjects and a family study of 1288 parent-offspring trios. No marker was significantly associated with severe malaria. We focused on T1264G, genotyping 10,922 samples from four African populations. The nonsense allele was not associated with severe malaria (pooled allelic odds ratio 1.0; 95% confidence interval 0.89-1.12; P = 0.98). These results suggest a range of possible explanations including the existence of alternative selection pressures on CD36, co-evolution between host and parasite or confounding caused by allelic heterogeneity of CD36 deficiency.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19403559"},{"text":"Rapidly evolving viruses and other pathogens can have an immense impact on human evolution as natural selection acts to increase the prevalence of genetic variants providing resistance to disease. With the emergence of large datasets of human genetic variation, we can search for signatures of natural selection in the human genome driven by such disease-causing microorganisms. Based on this approach, we have previously hypothesized that Lassa virus (LASV) may have been a driver of natural selection in West African populations where Lassa haemorrhagic fever is endemic. In this study, we provide further evidence for this notion. By applying tests for selection to genome-wide data from the International Haplotype Map Consortium and the 1000 Genomes Consortium, we demonstrate evidence for positive selection in LARGE and interleukin 21 (IL21), two genes implicated in LASV infectivity and immunity. We further localized the signals of selection, using the recently developed composite of multiple signals method, to introns and putative regulatory regions of those genes. Our results suggest that natural selection may have targeted variants giving rise to alternative splicing or differential gene expression of LARGE and IL21. Overall, our study supports the hypothesis that selective pressures imposed by LASV may have led to the emergence of particular alleles conferring resistance to Lassa fever, and opens up new avenues of research pursuit.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22312054"},{"text":"This pilot study demonstrated an association between polymorphisms in SLC40A1 and tuberculosis and provided evidence of an interaction between dietary iron and SLC40A1.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22357659"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19403559","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22312054","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22357659"],"type":"yesno","exact_answer":"yes","ideal_answer":"Rapidly evolving viruses and other pathogens can have an immense impact on human evolution as natural selection acts to increase the prevalence of genetic variants providing resistance to disease"}

Yet at any given time, not all group members perform the risky task of foraging. We previously hypothesized that tolerance for non-foragers was a component of extended parental care, previously known only for kin based social systems. DNA microsatellites were used to study colony genetic structure in order to test this hypothesis. Microsatellite polymorphism was substantial (He = 0.775). Overall intracolony relatedness, mainly of immatures, was low but significant in nine, late season nests (r = 0.136 +\/- 0.023), indicating that broods contain five to six unrelated sib ships. Detailed analyses of kinship between pairs of individuals revealed that most pairs were unrelated and most related pairs were siblings. Mothers are absent for 89-91% of the developing immature females, and 97% of developing males. Alternatively, 46% of adult females had neither sibs nor offspring in their nests.

{"body":"What selective factors drove the evolution of lactose in lactation?","snippets":[{"text":"Mammalian milk or colostrum contains up to 10% of carbohydrate, of which free lactose usually constitutes more than 80%. Lactose is synthesized within lactating mammary glands from uridine diphosphate galactose (UDP-Gal) and glucose by a transgalactosylation catalysed by a complex of \u03b24-galactosyltransferase and \u03b1-lactalbumin (\u03b1-LA). \u03b1-LA is believed to have evolved from C-type lysozyme. Mammalian milk or colostrum usually contains a variety of oligosaccharides in addition to free lactose. Each oligosaccharide has a lactose unit at its reducing end; this unit acts as a precursor that is essential for its biosynthesis. It is generally believed that milk oligosaccharides act as prebiotics and also as receptor analogues that act as anti-infection factors. We propose the following hypothesis. The proto-lacteal secretions of the primitive mammary glands of the common ancestor of mammals contained fat and protein including lysozyme, but no lactose or oligosaccharides because of the absence of \u03b1-LA. When \u03b1-LA first appeared as a result of its evolution from lysozyme, its content within the lactating mammary glands was low and lactose was therefore synthesized at a slow rate. Because of the presence of glycosyltransferases, almost all of the nascent lactose was utilized for the biosynthesis of oligosaccharides. The predominant saccharides in the proto-lacteal secretions or primitive milk produced by this common ancestor were therefore oligosaccharides rather than free lactose. Subsequent to this initial period, the oligosaccharides began to serve as anti-infection factors. They were then recruited as a significant energy source for the neonate, which was achieved by an increase in the synthesis of \u03b1-LA. This produced a concomitant increase in the concentration of lactose in the milk, and lactose therefore became an important energy source for most eutherians, whereas oligosaccharides continued to serve mainly as anti-microbial agents. Lactose, in addition, began to act as an osmoregulatory molecule, controlling the milk volume. Studies on the chemical structures of the milk oligosaccharides of a variety of mammalian species suggest that human milk or colostrum is unique in that oligosaccharides containing lacto-N-biose I (LNB) (Gal(\u03b21 \u2192 3)GlcNAc, type I) predominate over those containing N-acetyllactosamine (Gal(\u03b21 \u2192 4)GlcNAc, type II), whereas in other species only type II oligosaccharides are found or else they predominate over type I oligosaccharides.

Findings in a few species of lizards (Calotes versicolor) and snakes (Natrix natrix) showing gradual senescence support the concept of commonalities in ageing phenomena in vertebrates. An age-related increase in the stability of collagen and accumulation of altered enzyme molecules, a decrease in metabolism and response to stress-enhanced anti-oxidative defence mechanisms and the nature of responses to hormones, restricted diet and lower environmental temperature corroborate the concept. On the other hand neither the increase in mortality rate and accumulation of lipofuscin nor the reproductive senility have been shown conclusively in ageing reptile populations.

Both lean and obese subjects eventually reach energy balance and their body weight regulation implies that the adipose tissue mass is \"sensed\", leading to appropriate responses of energy intake and energy expenditure. The cloning of the ob gene and the identification of its encoded protein, leptin, have provided a system signaling the amount of adipose energy stores to the brain. Leptin, a hormone secreted by fat cells, acts in rodents via hypothalamic receptors to inhibit feeding and increase thermogenesis. A feedback regulatory loop with three distinct steps has been identified: (1) a sensor (leptin production by adipose cells) monitors the size of the adipose tissue mass; (2) hypothalamic centers receive and integrate the intensity of the leptin signal through leptin receptors (LRb); (3) effector systems, including the sympathetic nervous system, control the two main determinants of energy balance-energy intake and energy expenditure. While this feedback regulatory loop is well established in rodents, there are many unsolved questions about its applicability to body weight regulation in humans. The rate of leptin production is related to adiposity, but a large portion of the interindividual variability in plasma leptin concentration is independent of body fatness. Gender is an important factor determining plasma leptin, with women having markedly higher leptin concentrations than men for any given degree of fat mass. The ob mRNA expression is also upregulated by glucocorticoids, whereas stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system results in its inhibition. Furthermore, leptin is not a satiety factor in humans because changes in food intake do not induce short-term increases in plasma leptin levels. After its binding to LRb in the hypothalamus, leptin stimulates a specific signaling cascade that results in the inhibition of several orexigenic neuropeptides, while stimulating several anorexigenic peptides. The orexigenic neuropeptides that are downregulated by leptin are NPY (neuropeptide Y), MCH (melanin-concentrating hormone), orexins, and AGRP (agouti-related peptide). The anorexigenic neuropeptides that are upregulated by leptin are alpha-MSH (alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone), which acts on MC4R (melanocortin-4 receptor); CART (cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript); and CRH (corticotropin-releasing-hormone). Obese humans have high plasma leptin concentrations related to the size of adipose tissue, but this elevated leptin signal does not induce the expected responses (i.e., a reduction in food intake and an increase in energy expenditure). This suggests that obese humans are resistant to the effects of endogenous leptin. This resistance is also shown by the lack of effect of exogenous leptin administration to induce weight loss in obese patients. The mechanisms that may account for leptin resistance in human obesity include a limitation of the blood-brain-barrier transport system for leptin and an inhibition of the leptin signaling pathways in leptin-responsive hypothalamic neurons. During periods of energy deficit, the fall in leptin plasma levels exceeds the rate at which fat stores are decreased. Reduction of the leptin signal induces several neuroendocrine responses that tend to limit weight loss, such as hunger, food-seeking behavior, and suppression of plasma thyroid hormone levels. Conversely, it is unlikely that leptin has evolved to prevent obesity when plenty of palatable foods are available because the elevated plasma leptin levels resulting from the increased adipose tissue mass do not prevent the development of obesity. In conclusion, in humans, the leptin signaling system appears to be mainly involved in maintenance of adequate energy stores for survival during periods of energy deficit. Its role in the etiology of human obesity is only demonstrated in the very rare situations of absence of the leptin signal (mutations of the leptin gene or of the leptin receptor gene), which produces an internal perception of starvation and results in a chronic stimulation of excessive food intake.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12079865"},{"text":"Leptin, the gene product of adipose tissue that signals caloric plentitude via central nervous system receptors, may also have diverse peripheral metabolic actions.

In stepwise multivariate regression analysis serum leptin could be best predicted from BMI, serum insulin and serum DHEAS [leptin= (1.41 * BMI) - (0.01 * DHEAS) + (3.26 * insulin) - 26.3; model r2=0.24, p=0.001]. In conclusion, BMI and serum insulin have a positive while serum DHEAS has a negative impact on serum leptin. Neither endogenous estradiol, nor endogenous testosterone are associated with leptin levels.

A decline in serum leptin associated with calorie restriction instigates behavioral and metabolic adaptation, increasing appetite and conserving energy. Brain melanocortin-4 receptors (Mc4rs) are important mediators of leptin's effects on appetite and energy expenditure. Because subtle changes in function associated with heterozygous null mutations for either the Leptin (Lep-HET) or Mc4r genes (Mc4r-HET) increase adiposity, we tested the hypothesis that combined heterozygous mutations (Dbl-HET) would severely exacerbate diet-induced obesity (DIO) and insulin resistance in C57BL\/6J mice. Serum leptin levels were lower as a function of adiposity in heterozygous Leptin mutants (Lep-HET, Dbl-HET) matched with mice homozygous for the wild-type (WT) Lep gene (Mc4r-HET). Evidence for an additive interaction on adiposity in Dbl-HET mice maintained on a low-fat diet was observed at 10 wk of age. Male but not female mice developed DIO and insulin resistance on a high-fat diet. Compared with WT mice, DIO was more severe in Mc4r-HET but not Lep-HET mice, regardless of sex. However, the response of male and female Dbl-HET mice was different, with males being less and females being more responsive relative to Mc4r-HET. Glucose tolerance of Dbl-HET mice was not significantly different from WT mice in either sex. These results show a complex interaction between the Leptin and Mc4r genes that is influenced by age, gender, and diet. Remarkably, while heterozygous Lep mutations initially exacerbate obesity, in situations of severe obesity, reduced leptin levels may act oppositely and have beneficial effects on energy homeostasis.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17932216"},{"text":"The aim of this study was to investigate the regulation of leptin expression and production in cultured human adipocytes using the model of in vitro differentiated human adipocytes.

To investigate how DA transport is regulated in intact tissue and to examine how amphetamine affects the DAT, the kinetics of DA uptake by the DAT were examined in tissue slices of the mouse caudate-putamen with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry. The data demonstrate that inward DA transport is saturable and sodium-dependent. Elevated levels of cytoplasmic DA resulting from disruption of vesicular storage by incubation with 10 microM Ro 4-1284 did not generate DA efflux or decrease its uptake rate. However, incubation with 10 microM amphetamine reduced the net DA uptake rate and increased extracellular DA levels due to DA efflux through the DAT. In addition, a new, elevated steady-state level of extracellular DA was established after electrically stimulated DA release in the presence of amphetamine, norepinephrine, and exogenous DA.

We call this ratio the filling fraction and calculate it from geometrical analysis and anatomical data. The filling fraction is 0.26 in mouse neocortex, 0.22-0.34 in rat hippocampus. In the macaque visual cortex, the filling fraction increases by a factor of 1.6-1.8 from area V1 to areas V2, V4, and 7a.

Serial-section electron microscopy of imaged dendritic segments revealed retrospectively that spine sprouting and retraction are associated with synapse formation and elimination.

Eight weeks later, the tendency for these neurons to orient their dendritic arbors toward the center of their home barrel was found to be disrupted by the resultant reduced activity of thalamocortical innervation. Measures of spine density and total dendritic length were normal, indicating that the loss of dendritic bias was accompanied by growth of dendrites directed away from the barrel center.

Under baseline conditions, new spines are mostly transient and rarely survive for more than a week. Transient spines tend to be small, whereas persistent spines are usually large. Because most excitatory synapses in the cortex occur on spines, and because synapse size and the number of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors are proportional to spine volume, the excitation of pyramidal neurons is probably driven through synapses on persistent spines. Here we test whether the generation and loss of persistent spines are enhanced by novel sensory experience. We repeatedly imaged dendritic spines for one month after trimming alternate whiskers, a paradigm that induces adaptive functional changes in neocortical circuits. Whisker trimming stabilized new spines and destabilized previously persistent spines. New-persistent spines always formed synapses.

Excitatory synaptic structures, such as dendritic spines, are dynamic entities that remain sensitive to alteration of sensory input throughout life. It remains unclear, however, whether structural changes at the level of dendritic spines can outlast the original experience and thereby provide a morphological basis for long-term information storage. Here we follow spine dynamics on apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons in functionally defined regions of adult mouse visual cortex during plasticity of eye-specific responses induced by repeated closure of one eye (monocular deprivation). The first monocular deprivation episode doubled the rate of spine formation, thereby increasing spine density. This effect was specific to layer-5 cells located in binocular cortex, where most neurons increase their responsiveness to the non-deprived eye. Restoring binocular vision returned spine dynamics to baseline levels, but absolute spine density remained elevated and many monocular deprivation-induced spines persisted during this period of functional recovery. However, spine addition did not increase again when the same eye was closed for a second time. This absence of structural plasticity stands out against the robust changes of eye-specific responses that occur even faster after repeated deprivation. Thus, spines added during the first monocular deprivation experience may provide a structural basis for subsequent functional shifts. These results provide a strong link between functional plasticity and specific synaptic rearrangements, revealing a mechanism of how prior experiences could be stored in cortical circuits.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19005470"},{"text":"Novel motor skills are learned through repetitive practice and, once acquired, persist long after training stops.

Here we show that synaptic connections in the living mouse brain rapidly respond to motor-skill learning and permanently rewire. Training in a forelimb reaching task leads to rapid (within an hour) formation of postsynaptic dendritic spines on the output pyramidal neurons in the contralateral motor cortex. Although selective elimination of spines that existed before training gradually returns the overall spine density back to the original level, the new spines induced during learning are preferentially stabilized during subsequent training and endure long after training stops. Furthermore, we show that different motor skills are encoded by different sets of synapses.

Although there is currently no cure, drugs targeting the dopaminergic system provide major symptomatic relief. As well, agents directed to other neurotransmitter systems are of therapeutic benefit. Such drugs may act by directly improving functional deficits in these other systems, or they may restore aberrant motor activity that arises as a result of a dopaminergic imbalance. Recent research attention has focused on a role for drugs targeting the nicotinic cholinergic systems. The rationale for such work stems from basic research findings that there is an extensive overlap in the organization and function of the nicotinic cholinergic and dopaminergic systems in the basal ganglia. In addition, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) drugs could have clinical potential for Parkinson's disease. Evidence for this proposition stems from studies with experimental animal models showing that nicotine protects against neurotoxin-induced nigrostriatal damage and improves motor complications associated with l-DOPA, the \"gold standard\" for Parkinson's disease treatment. Nicotine interacts with multiple central nervous system receptors to generate therapeutic responses but also produces side effects. It is important therefore to identify the nAChR subtypes most beneficial for treating Parkinson's disease.

Because insulin secretion in vivo can be rapidly tuned by changes in pancreatic microcirculation, we evaluated the influence of acute alcohol administration on pancreatic islet blood flow (IBF), and dynamic changes in insulin secretion and glycemia in the rat. Ethanol (10%) or saline was iv injected as a bolus into Wistar rats, yielding serum ethanol concentrations of approximately 8 mmol\/liter. Measurements of pancreatic blood flow (PBF) were performed by a microsphere technique in combination with a freeze-thawing technique after 10-min injection.

The alcohol also augmented late-phase insulin secretion and induced late hypoglycemia upon ip glucose tolerance tests. The nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N-w-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester and atropine prevented the increased pancreatic IBF, enhanced insulin secretion, and hypoglycemia evoked by ethanol. Thus, our findings demonstrate that ethanol acutely exerts substantial influences on pancreatic microcirculation by evoking a massive redistribution of PBF from the exocrine into the endocrine part via mechanisms mediated by nitric oxide and vagal stimuli, augmenting late-phase insulin secretion, and thereby evoking hypoglycemia.

As the temperature of the tissues rapidly falls, sympathetic nerve conduction is interrupted and vasodilatation occurs, due to the cessation of norepinephrine release and the depressor action of cold on the contractile machinery. The resultant return of blood flow rewarms the tissue, nerve conduction is reestablished, and this combined with the increased affinity of the alpha-adrenoceptors for norepinephrine leads to renewed vasoconstriction.

Exposure of the animals to light at night inhibited the night-stimulated NAT activity. Treatment of rats and rabbits with the dopaminergic agonist, apomorphine, inhibited the retinal NAT activity. Dopamine levels in the rabbit retina showed diurnal variations, with higher contents seen during the light phase of both the 12 h light-dark cycle with lights on between 06:00-18:00, and that with reversed periods of illumination (lights on between 18:00-06:00). Melatonin potently inhibited the electrically-evoked calcium-dependent release of [(3)H]dopamine from pieces of retina from both albino and pigmented rabbits. Our results indicate that the light-regulated melatonin-generating system does operate in the vertebrate retina. The present data, together with other findings, suggest that in the retina there is an antagonistic interplay between melatonin and dopamine. Thus, melatonin inhibits dopamine synthesis in, and release from, the retinal dopaminergic cells, whilst dopamine inhibits the night (dark)-stimulated melatonin formation by decreasing NAT activity. Since light increases metabolic activity of the retinal dopaminergic cells (it enhances the amine synthesis, levels and release), it seems likely that the retinal dopamine plays a role of a \"light\" messenger in the inhibition of melatonin synthesis.

In the present study, we show by FACS analysis that unconjugated antennapedia, TAT, transportan and polyarginine demonstrate similar kinetic uptake profiles, being maximal at 1-3 h and independent of cell type (HeLa, A549 and CHO cell lines). A comparison of the magnitude of uptake of cell-penetrating peptide conjugates demonstrated that polyarginine=transportan>antennapedia>TAT. However, examination of cellular toxicity showed that antennapedia<TAT<transportan< intersectionpolyarginine, with antennapedia-peptide conjugates having no significant toxicity even at 100 microM. Confocal studies of the mechanism of antennapedia- and TAT-peptide uptake showed that the time course of uptake and their cellular distribution did not correlate with transferrin, a marker of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In contrast, the peptides co-localised with a marker of lipid rafts domains, cholera toxin, which was attenuated following the disruption of these domains using methyl-beta-cyclodextrin.

Pedigree and twin studies indicate that homosexuality has substantial heritability in both sexes, yet concordance between identical twins is low and molecular studies have failed to find associated DNA makers. This paradoxical pattern calls for an explanation. We use published data on fetal androgen signaling and gene regulation via nongenetic changes in DNA packaging (epigenetics) to develop a new model for homosexuality. It is well established that fetal androgen signaling strongly influences sexual development. We show that an unappreciated feature of this process is reduced androgen sensitivity in XX fetuses and enhanced sensitivity in XY fetuses, and that this difference is most feasibly mused by numerous sex-specific epigenetic modifications (\"epi-marks\") originating in embryonic stem cells. These epi-marks buffer XX fetuses from masculinization due to excess fetal androgen exposure and similarly buffer XY fetuses from androgen underexposure. Extant data indicates that individual epi-marks influence some but not other sexually dimorphic traits, vary in strength across individuals, and are produced during ontogeny and erased between generations. Those that escape erasure will steer development of the sexual phenotypes they influence in a gonad-discordant direction in opposite sex offspring, mosaically feminizing XY offspring and masculinizing XX offspring. Such sex-specific epi-marks are sexually antagonistic (SA-epi-marks) because they canalize sexual development in the parent that produced them, but contribute to gonad-trait discordances in opposite-sex offspring when unerased. In this model, homosexuality occurs when stronger-than-average SA-epi-marks (influencing sexual preference) from an opposite-sex parent escape erasure and are then paired with a weaker-than-average de novo sex-specific epi-marks produced in opposite-sex offspring. Our model predicts that homosexuality is part of a wider phenomenon in which recently evolved androgen-influenced traits commonly display gonad-trait discordances at substantial frequency, and that the molecular feature underlying most homosexuality is not DNA polymorphism(s), but epi-marks that evolved to canalize sexual dimorphic development that sometimes carryover across generations and contribute to gonad-trait discordances in opposite-sex descendants.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23397798"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23397798"],"type":"not_usable","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":""}

Asexual animals maintain telomere length somatically during reproduction by fission or when regeneration is induced by amputation, whereas sexual animals only achieve telomere elongation through sexual reproduction. We demonstrate that this difference is reflected in the expression and alternate splicing of the protein subunit of the telomerase enzyme. Asexual adult planarian stem cells appear to maintain telomere length over evolutionary timescales without passage through a germ-line stage. The adaptations we observe demonstrate indefinite somatic telomerase activity in proliferating stem cells during regeneration or reproduction by fission, and establish planarians as a pertinent model for studying telomere structure, function, and maintenance.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22371573"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18445486","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22371573"],"type":"not_usable","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":""}
{"body":"Why do red blood cells contain haemoglobin and not myoglobin?","snippets":[{"text":"Neutron spin-echo spectroscopy was used to study structural fluctuations that occur in hemoglobin (Hb) and myoglobin (Mb) in solution. Using neutron spin-echo data up to a very high momentum transfer q ( approximately 0.62 A(-)(1)), we characterized the internal dynamics of these proteins at the levels of dynamic pair correlation function and self-correlation function in the time range of several picoseconds to a few nanoseconds. In the same protein solution, data transition from pair correlation motion to self-correlation motion as the momentum transfer q increases. At low q, coherent scattering dominates; at high q, observations are largely due to incoherent scattering. The low q data were interpreted in terms of an effective diffusion coefficient; on the other hand, the high q data were interpreted in terms of mean square displacements. Comparison of data from the two homologous proteins collected at different temperatures and protein concentrations was used to assess the contributions made by translational and rotational diffusion and internal modes of motion to the data. The temperature dependence of decay times can be attributed to changes in the viscosity and temperature of the solvent, as predicted by the Stokes-Einstein relationship. This is true for contributions from both diffusive and internal modes of motion, indicating an intimate relationship between the internal dynamics of the proteins and the viscosity of the solvent. Viscosity change associated with protein concentration can account for changes in diffusion observed at different concentrations, but is apparently not the only factor involved in the changes in internal dynamics observed with change in protein concentration. Data collected at high q indicate that internal modes in Mb are generally faster than those in Hb, perhaps due to the greater surface-to-volume ratio of Mb and the fact that surface groups tend to exhibit faster motion than buried groups. Comparison of data from Hb and data from Mb at low q indicates an unexpectedly rapid motion of Hb alphabeta dimers relative to one another. Dynamic motion of subunits is increasingly perceived as important to the allosteric behavior of Hb. Our data demonstrate that this motion is highly sensitive to protein concentration, temperature, and solvent viscosity, indicating that great care needs to be exercised in interpreting its effect on protein function.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20096701"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20096701"],"type":"not_usable","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":""}

To evaluate the safety of nucleic acid staining by SYBR Gold and SYBR Green II we compared the mutagenicity of these compounds, with characteristics corresponding to those of ethidium bromide, by use of the Salmonella\/mammalian microsome reverse-mutation assays (Ames test). SYBR Green II and SYBR Gold did not show mutagenicity either in frame-shift or in base-substitution indicator strains, TA98 and TA100, respectively. These results were observed both in the presence and in the absence of supernatant from a rat-liver homogenate S9. Mutagenicity of these stains was not observed although their toxic concentration was reached. Toxic effects of SYBR Green II and SYBR Gold were seen approximately at the same molar concentrations as reported previously for SYBR Green I. As expected, ethidium bromide revealed strong mutagenicity with a maximum increase of 60-fold above the vehicle controls in the frame-shift indicator strain TA98 in the presence of rat-liver S9 extract.

However, the exact involvement of dopamine in the control of sexual motivation and genital arousal in males is unknown. Experimental data in male rats suggested an implication of dopamine in sexual motivation as well as in copulatory performance. Specific tests allowing assessment of sexual motivation showed that the release of dopamine at the level of the nucleus accumbens (innervated by the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway) and the medial preoptic area of the hypothalamus (innervated by the dopaminergic incertohypothalamic pathway) positively regulated the anticipatory\/motivational phase of copulatory behavior. A permissive role of dopamine released at the level of the median preoptic area of the hypothalamus in the display of copulatory behavior has also been demonstrated. It is noteworthy that these participations of the dopaminergic system are not specific for sexual behavior but rather reflect the involvement of dopamine in the regulation of cognitive, integrative and reward processes. Because of its role in the control of locomotor activity, the integrity of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway is also essential for the display of copulatory behavior. Somehow more specific to sexual function, it is likely that dopamine can trigger penile erection by acting on oxytocinergic neurons located in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, and perhaps on the pro-erectile sacral parasympathetic nucleus within the spinal cord.

Dopamine has facilitative effects on sexual motivation, copulatory proficiency, and genital reflexes. Dopamine in the nigrostriatal tract influences motor activity; in the mesolimbic tract it activates numerous motivated behaviors, including copulation; in the medial preoptic area (MPOA) it controls genital reflexes, copulatory patterns, and specifically sexual motivation. Testosterone increases nitric oxide synthase in the MPOA; nitric oxide increases basal and female-stimulated dopamine release, which in turn facilitates copulation and genital reflexes. Serotonin (5-HT) is primarily inhibitory, although stimulation of 5-HT(2C) receptors increases erections and inhibits ejaculation, whereas stimulation of 5-HT(1A) receptors has the opposite effects: facilitation of ejaculation and, in some circumstances, inhibition of erection. 5-HT is released in the anterior lateral hypothalamus at the time of ejaculation.

The clinical spectrum of effects for modafinil is distinct from the effects seen with other catecholaminergic agents. Relative to other commonly used agents that act through catecholaminergic mechanisms, modafinil has a relatively low abuse potential, produces wakefulness with an attenuated compensatory sleep recovery thereafter, and does not ameliorate cataplexy in narcolepsy. These clinically relevant phenomenological differences between modafinil and agents such as amphetamines and cocaine do not eliminate catecholaminergic effects as a possible mediator of its wake-promoting action; they merely reflect its unique pharmacological profile. Modafinil is an exceptionally weak, but apparently very selective, DA transporter inhibitor. The pharmacodynamic response to modafinil, as measured by DA levels in brain microdialyzate, is protracted relative to other agents that act via catecholaminergic mechanisms. The conformational constraints on the interaction of modafinil with the DA transporter - and probably, as a consequence, its effects on trace amine receptor signaling in the catecholaminergic cell - are unique among catecholaminergic agents.

Here I propose a model for an ancestral proto-anti-codon RNA (pacRNA) auto-aminoacylation system and show that pacRNAs would naturally manifest features of the codon table. I show that pacRNAs could implement all the steps for auto-aminoacylation: amino acid coordination, intermediate activation of the amino acid by the 5'-end of the pacRNA, and 3'-aminoacylation of the pacRNA. The anti-codon cradles of pacRNAs would have been able to recognize and coordinate only a small number of L-amino acids via hydrogen bonding. A need for proper spatial coordination would have limited the number of chargeable amino acids for all anti-codon sequences, in addition to making some anti-codon sequences unsuitable. Thus, the pacRNA model implies that the idiosyncrasies of the anti-codon table and L-amino acid homochirality co-evolved during a single evolutionary period.

Pharmacological FAS inhibitors cerulenin and C75 were found to suppress p185(HER2) oncoprotein expression and tyrosine-kinase activity in breast and ovarian HER2 overexpressors. Similarly, p185(HER2) expression was dramatically down-regulated when FAS gene expression was silenced by using the highly sequence-specific mechanism of RNA interference (RNAi). Pharmacological and RNAi-mediated silencing of FAS specifically down-regulated HER2 mRNA and, concomitantly, caused a prominent up-regulation of PEA3, a transcriptional repressor of HER2. A cytoplasmic redistribution of p185(HER2) was associated with marked morphological changes of FAS RNAi-transfected cells, whereas chemical inhibitors of FAS promoted a striking nuclear accumulation of p185(HER2). The simultaneous targeting of FAS and HER2 by chemical FAS inhibitors and the humanized antibody directed against p185(HER2) trastuzumab, respectively, was synergistically cytotoxic toward HER2 overexpressors. Similarly, concurrent RNAi-mediated silencing of FAS and HER2 genes synergistically stimulated apoptotic cell death in HER2 overexpressors. p185(HER2) was synergistically down-regulated after simultaneous inhibition of FAS and HER2 by either pharmacological inhibitors or small interfering RNA.

Altered omega-3 fatty acid status has been implicated in reduced resistance to stress and mood disorders. We therefore evaluated the effects of repeated restraint stress (6 h\/day for 21 days) on adult rats fed omega-3 deficient, control or omega-3 enriched diets from conception. We measured body weight, plasma corticosterone and hippocampus glucocorticoid receptors and correlated these data with emotional and depression-like behaviour assessed by their open-field (OF) activity, anxiety in the elevated-plus maze (EPM), the sucrose preference test and the startle response. We also determined their plasma and brain membrane lipid profiles by gas chromatography. Repeated restraint stress caused rats fed a control diet to lose weight. Their plasma corticosterone increased and they showed moderate behavioural changes, with increases only in grooming (OF test) and entries into the open arms (EPM). Rats fed the omega-3 enriched diet had a lower stress-induced weight loss and plasma corticosterone peak, and reduced grooming. Rats chronically lacking omega-3 fatty acid exhibited an increased startle response, a stress-induced decrease in locomotor activity and exaggerated grooming. The brain omega-3 fatty acids increased as the dietary omega-3 fatty acids increased; diets containing preformed long-chain omega-3 fatty acid were better than diets containing the precursor alpha-linolenic acid. However, the restraint stress reduced the amounts of omega-3 incorporated. These data showed that the response to chronic restraint stress was modulated by the omega-3 fatty acid supply, a dietary deficiency was deleterious while enrichment protecting against stress.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22860066"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22860066"],"type":"not_usable","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":""}

In contrast, downregulation of the expression of the long form of brain prolactin receptors by chronic intracerebroventricular infusion of an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) (osmotic minipump, 0.5 microg. 0.5 microl(-1). hr(-1); 5 d) increased anxiety-related behavior on the plus-maze compared with mixed bases-treated and vehicle-treated rats (p < 0.01), again demonstrating an anxiolytic effect of PRL acting at brain level. Furthermore, in jugular vein-catheterized female rats, the stress-induced increase of corticotropin secretion was decreased after chronic intracerebroventricular infusion of oPRL (osmotic minipump, 1.0 microg. 0.5 microl(-1). hr(-1); p < 0.05) and, in contrast, was further elevated by antisense targeting of the brain prolactin receptors (p < 0.01). This provides evidence for a receptor-mediated attenuation of the responsiveness of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis by prolactin. The antisense ODN sequence was selected on the basis of secondary structure molecular modeling of the target mRNA to improve antisense ODN-mRNA hybridization. Receptor autoradiography confirmed the expected improvement in the efficacy of downregulation of prolactin receptor expression [empirically designed antisense, 30%; p > 0.05, not significant; adjustment of target position after mRNA modeling, 72%; p < 0.05).

Thus we investigated the role of prolactin-releasing peptide (PrRP), found in the ventrolateral medulla and the nucleus of the solitary tract, which is known to project to the PVN during running-induced ACTH release. Accumulation of c-Fos in PrRP neurons correlated with running speeds, reaching maximal levels under running stress. Intracerebroventricular injection of neutralizing anti-PrRP antibodies led to increased plasma ACTH level and blood lactate accumulation during running stress, but not during restraint stress. Exogenous intracerebroventricular administration of low doses of PrRP had the opposite effects. Therefore, our results suggest that, during running stress, PrRP-containing neurons are activated in an exercise intensity-dependent manner, and likewise the produced endogenous PrRP attenuates ACTH release and blood lactate accumulation during running stress.

Ovariectomized, estradiol-substituted Wistar rats were implanted with an intracerebroventricular cannula and treated with ovine PRL (0.01, 0.1 or 1 microg\/h; 5 days via osmotic minipumps) or vehicle, and their responses to acute restraint stress was assessed. Chronic PRL treatment exerted an anxiolytic effect on the elevated plus-maze, and attenuated the acute restraint-induced rise in plasma adrenocorticotropin, corticosterone and noradrenaline. At the neuronal level, in situ hybridization revealed PRL effects on the expression patterns of the immediate-early gene c-fos and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF). Under basal conditions, PRL significantly reduced c-fos mRNA expression within the central amygdala. In response to restraint, the expression of both c-fos mRNA and protein and of CRF mRNA was decreased in the parvocellular part of the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of PRL-treated compared with vehicle-treated animals. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that chronic elevation of PRL levels within the brain results in reduced neuronal activation within the hypothalamus, specifically within the PVN, in response to an acute stressor. Thus, PRL acting at various relevant brain regions exerts profound anxiolytic and anti-stress effects, and is likely to contribute to the attenuated stress responsiveness found in the peripartum period, when brain PRL levels are physiologically upregulated.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17432967"},{"text":"S100B is an astroglial protein that is increased in the peripheral bloodstream after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Elevated serum levels of S100B have been shown to be predictive of mild TBI. Furthermore, physical activity (PA) can affect S100B levels. Interestingly, increased serum S100B concentrations have been detected in athletes without apparent TBI. Such increases could be attributed to tissue hypoperfusion reflected by blood lactate concentrations [BLa(-)] and\/or increased serotonergic activity reflected by prolactin (PRL). The impact of increased blood lactates on peripheral S100B levels per se are yet unknown. The purpose of our study was to investigate if increased blood lactate induced by sodium lactate infusion, without the \"side effects\" of PA, resulted in changes in serum S100B and PRL. Twelve male adults were given a sodium lactate infusion for a period of 24 min by a perfusor with an infusion rate of 0.01 mL kg(-1) min(-1), increased every 3 min. The main outcome measures showed no increase in serum S100B (p > 0.05). Prolactin increased significantly (p < 0.05) after [BLa(-)] exceeded a concentration of 4 mmol L(-1). Furthermore, the expected values of blood lactate achieved peak values ranging from 11 to 15 mmol L(-1). We conclude that neither increased blood lactate nor serum PRL play an exclusive role in the regulation of S100B.

The PRLR is also a member of a larger family, known as the cytokine class-1 receptor superfamily, which currently has more than 20 different members. PRLRs or binding sites are widely distributed throughout the body. In fact, it is difficult to find a tissue that does not express any PRLR mRNA or protein. In agreement with this wide distribution of receptors is the fact that now more than 300 separate actions of PRL have been reported in various vertebrates, including effects on water and salt balance, growth and development, endocrinology and metabolism, brain and behavior, reproduction, and immune regulation and protection. Clearly, a large proportion of these actions are directly or indirectly associated with the process of reproduction, including many behavioral effects. PRL is also becoming well known as an important regulator of immune function. A number of disease states, including the growth of different forms of cancer as well as various autoimmune diseases, appear to be related to an overproduction of PRL, which may act in an endocrine, autocrine, or paracrine manner, or via an increased sensitivity to the hormone. The first step in the mechanism of action of PRL is the binding to a cell surface receptor. The ligand binds in a two-step process in which site 1 on PRL binds to one receptor molecule, after which a second receptor molecule binds to site 2 on the hormone, forming a homodimer consisting of one molecule of PRL and two molecules of receptor. The PRLR contains no intrinsic tyrosine kinase cytoplasmic domain but associates with a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase, JAK2. Dimerization of the receptor induces tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the JAK kinase followed by phosphorylation of the receptor. Other receptor-associated kinases of the Src family have also been shown to be activated by PRL. One major pathway of signaling involves phosphorylation of cytoplasmic State proteins, which themselves dimerize and translocate to nucleus and bind to specific promoter elements on PRL-responsive genes. In addition, the Ras\/Raf\/MAP kinase pathway is also activated by PRL and may be involved in the proliferative effects of the hormone. Finally, a number of other potential mediators have been identified, including IRS-1, PI-3 kinase, SHP-2, PLC gamma, PKC, and intracellular Ca2+. The technique of gene targeting in mice has been used to develop the first experimental model in which the effect of the complete absence of any lactogen or PRL-mediated effects can be studied. Heterozygous (+\/-) females show almost complete failure to lactate after the first, but not subsequent, pregnancies. Homozygous (-\/-) females are infertile due to multiple reproductive abnormalities, including ovulation of premeiotic oocytes, reduced fertilization of oocytes, reduced preimplantation oocyte development, lack of embryo implantation, and the absence of pseudopregnancy. Twenty per cent of the homozygous males showed delayed fertility. Other phenotypes, including effects on the immune system and bone, are currently being examined. It is clear that there are multiple actions associated with PRL. It will be important to correlate known effects with local production of PRL to differentiate classic endocrine from autocrine\/paracrine effects. The fact that extrapituitary PRL can, under some circumstances, compensate for pituitary PRL raises the interesting possibility that there may be effects of PRL other than those originally observed in hypophysectomized rats. The PRLR knockout mouse model should be an interesting system by which to look for effects activated only by PRL or other lactogenic hormones. On the other hand, many of the effects reported in this review may be shared with other hormones, cytokines, or growth factors and thus will be more difficult to study.

Mammalian lenses are mainly comprised of epithelial-derived fiber cells. Concentrically arranged fibers are precisely aligned as they elongate along the anterior-posterior axis and orientate towards lens poles where they meet fibers from other segments to form characteristic sutures. We show that lens exhibits PCP, with each fiber cell having an apically situated cilium and in most cases this is polarised towards the anterior pole. Frizzled and other PCP proteins are also asymmetrically localised along the equatorial-anterior axis. Mutations in core PCP genes Van Gogh-like 2 and Celsr1 perturb oriented fiber alignment and suture formation. Suppression of the PCP pathway by overexpressing Sfrp2 shows that whilst local groups of fibers are often similarly oriented, they lack global orientation; consequently when local groups of fibers with different orientations meet they form multiple, small, ectopic suture-like configurations.

Central to its development were RNAs that spawned the modern tRNAs and a symmetrical region deep within the large ribosomal RNA, (rRNA), where the peptidyl transferase reaction occurs. To understand pre-LUCA developments, it is argued that events that are coupled in time are especially useful if one can infer a likely order in which they occurred. Using such timing events, the relative age of various proteins and individual regions within the large rRNA are inferred. An examination of the properties of modern ribosomes strongly suggests that the initial peptides made by the primitive ribosomes were likely enriched for l-amino acids, but did not completely exclude d-amino acids. This has implications for the nature of peptides made by the first ribosomes. From the perspective of ribosome origins, the immediate question regarding coding is when did it arise rather than how did the assignments evolve. The modern ribosome is very dynamic with tRNAs moving in and out and the mRNA moving relative to the ribosome. These movements may have become possible as a result of the addition of a template to hold the tRNAs. That template would subsequently become the mRNA, thereby allowing the evolution of the code and making an RNA genome useful. Finally, a highly speculative timeline of major events in ribosome history is presented and possible future directions discussed.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20534711"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20534711"],"type":"not_usable","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":""}

This dominantly inherited genetic trait is known as lactase persistence. The distribution of these different lactase phenotypes in human populations is highly variable and is controlled by a polymorphic element cis-acting to the lactase gene. A putative causal nucleotide change has been identified and occurs on the background of a very extended haplotype that is frequent in Northern Europeans, where lactase persistence is frequent. This single nucleotide polymorphism is located 14 kb upstream from the start of transcription of lactase in an intron of the adjacent gene MCM6.

Because the 'spinning dope' (the material from which silk is spun) is liquid crystalline, spiders can draw it during extrusion into a hardened fibre using minimal forces. This process involves an unusual internal drawdown within the spider's spinneret that is not seen in industrial fibre processing, followed by a conventional external drawdown after the dope has left the spinneret.

Subsequent signal transduction involves activation of the janus kinase (JAK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins. STAT proteins are translocated into the nucleus, where they bind to the promoter region of target genes and are thereby involved in regulating the transcription of target genes. In the first part, the present review focusses on the role of STAT3 in ischemia\/reperfusion injury and in cardioprotection by ischemic pre- and postconditioning. In the heart, ischemia induces an increase in IL-6 cytokines, which is associated with activation of STAT3. Genetic modification of the myocardial STAT3 protein content shows a protective role of STAT3 on infarct size after ischemia\/reperfusion injury. The cardioprotection by both early and late ischemic preconditioning as well as by ischemic postconditioning involves an activation of STAT3 and is dependent on STAT3 protein level. Whereas the infarct-sparing effect of late preconditioning is clearly mediated by an increase in transcription-mediated protein synthesis, early preconditioning is independent of gene transcription, suggesting a role of STAT3 independent of transcriptional regulation. Possibly, STAT3 plays a role in modifying mitochondrial function, organelles central for the cardioprotection by pre- and postconditioning. In the second part, the role of STAT3 in physiological stresses such as aging and pregnancy, as well as in pathophysiological situations such as myocardial infarction and heart failure is summarized.

The fundamental requirement for fixed forms of nitrogen for life on Earth, both at present and in the past, has led to broad and significant interest in the origin and evolution of biological N2 fixation. One key question is whether the limited availability of fixed nitrogen was a factor in life's origin or whether there were ample sources of fixed nitrogen produced by abiotic processes or delivered through the weathering of bolide impact materials to support this early life. If the latter, the key questions become what were the characteristics of the environment that precipitated the evolution of this oxygen sensitive process, when did this occur, and how was its subsequent evolutionary history impacted by the advent of oxygenic photosynthesis and the rise of oxygen in the Earth's biosphere. Since the availability of fixed sources of nitrogen capable of supporting early life is difficult to glean from the geologic record, there are limited means to get direct insights into these questions. Indirect insights, however, can be gained through phylogenetic studies of nitrogenase structural gene products and additional gene products involved in the biosynthesis of the complex metal-containing prosthetic groups associated with this enzyme complex.

We report that binding of integrin-specific ligands to a suppressive integrin can inhibit the function of other target integrins (trans-dominant inhibition). Trans-dominant inhibition is due to a blockade of integrin signaling. Furthermore, this inhibition involves both a conformational change in the extracellular domain and the presence of the beta cytoplasmic tail in the suppressive integrin. Similarly, ligand-induced recruitment of alpha IIb beta 3 to focal adhesions also involves a conformational rearrangement of its extracellular domain. These findings imply that the ligand-induced conformational changes can propagate from an integrin's extracellular to its intracellular face. Trans-dominant inhibition by integrin ligands may coordinate integrin signaling and can lead to unexpected biological effects of integrin-specific inhibitors.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8970156"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8970156"],"type":"not_usable","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":""}

Over the past twenty years it has become apparent that families of beta-lactamases have been selected as the result of antimicrobial usage. Outbreaks of beta-lactam-resistant bacteria can be traced to the introduction of specific classes of beta-lactams or to the introduction of a specific agent. Many of the most serious epidemics can be related to transferable beta-lactamase genes that are harboured on multidrug-resistant plasmids. The separation of beta-lactamases into three major functional groups or four structural classes has been proposed. Stepwise selection of variants within several of these classes has been documented both in the clinical setting and in the laboratory, e.g. the extended-spectrum (TEM and SHV) beta-lactamases and the inhibitor-resistant (TEM) beta-lactamases.

Competition for [3H]-clonidine binding in rat liver mitochondrial fractions by imidazol(ine)\/guanidine compounds revealed that the pharmacological profile of the interaction (2-styryl-2-imidazoline, LSL 61112 > idazoxan > 2-benzofuranyl-2-imidazoline, 2-BFI = cirazoline > guanabenz > oxymetazoline > > clonidine) was typical of that for I2-sites. 3.

Other imidazol(ine)\/guanidine drugs also were weak MAO inhibitors with the exception of guanabenz, 2-BFI and cirazoline on MAO-A (IC50S: 4-11 microM) and 2-benzofuranyl-2-imidazol (LSL 60101) on MAO-B (IC50: 16 microM). Idazoxan was a full inhibitor although with rather low potency, on both MAO-A and MAO-B isoenzymes (IC50S: 280 microM and 624 microM, respectively). Kinetic analyses of MAO-A inhibition by these drugs revealed that the interactions were competitive. For the same drugs acting on MAO-B the interactions were of the mixed type inhibition (increased K(m) and decreased Vmax values), although the greater inhibitory effects on the apparent value of Vmax\/K(m) than on the Vmax value indicated that the competitive element of the MAO-B inhibition predominated. 4.

This further suggested a direct drug interaction with the catalytic sites of MAO-A and MAO-B isoforms. 5.

These discrepancies indicated that I2-imidazoline receptors are not directly related to the site of action of these drugs on MAO activity in rat liver mitochondrial fractions. 6.

Recent studies, however, suggest that the rate of elongation during exponential growth of bacterial cells decreases cumulatively with replicative age for both asymmetrically and symmetrically dividing organisms, implying that a \"steady-state\" population consists of individual cells that are never in a steady state of growth. To resolve this seeming paradoxical observation, we studied the long-term growth and division patterns of Escherichia coli cells by employing a microfluidic device designed to follow steady-state growth and division of a large number of cells at a defined reproductive age. Our analysis of approximately 10(5) individual cells reveals a remarkable stability of growth whereby the mother cell inherits the same pole for hundreds of generations.

The basic structure of the liver is formed by the end of the first trimester. The fetal hepatic circulation differs substantially from that of the adult in that there is an extra input vessel, the umbilical vein, and there is shunting of 30-70% of hepatic blood flow via the ductus venosus. The left and right lobes of the fetal liver seem to function independently with respect to a variety of biochemical parameters, due at least in part to the lower oxygen supply to the right lobe. The zonation of drug-metabolizing enzymes along the hepatic acinus, which is prominent in the adult liver, is absent in the fetal liver. Unlike rodent species, the human fetal liver has a significant capacity for drug metabolism. Of the oxidative enzymes, CYP3A7 accounts for up to 50% of total fetal hepatic cytochrome P450 content. Expression of this enzyme decreases dramatically after birth. CYP1A1 and CYP2D6 have also been detected in human fetal liver, but whether CYP2E1 is expressed remains controversial. Several other cytochrome P450s have been identified and await characterization. Fetal hepatic drug conjugation may prolong fetal exposure to the metabolites produced, which, being more water soluble, do not readily cross the placenta back to the mother and, if excreted in fetal urine, can be recycled in the fetus via amniotic fluid and fetal swallowing. Limited activity of glucuronidation enzymes has been demonstrated in human fetal liver in contrast to the activity of sulfation enzymes, which is significant. Limited in vivo studies in fetal sheep have demonstrated significant fetal hepatic drug elimination, and this has been confirmed in studies of the isolated perfused fetal sheep liver.

We therefore hypothesize that hair bulb melanocytes are especially susceptible to free radical-induced aging. To test this hypothesis, we subjected human scalp skin anagen hair follicles from graying individuals to macroscopic and immunohistomorphometric analysis and organ culture. We found evidence of melanocyte apoptosis and increased oxidative stress in the pigmentary unit of graying hair follicles.

Cultured unpigmented hair follicles grew better than pigmented follicles of the same donors. Finally, cultured pigmented hair follicles exposed to exogenous oxidative stress (hydroquinone) showed increased melanocyte apoptosis in the hair bulb.

In men and postmenopausal women, the most common causes of iron deficiency anemia are gastrointestinal blood loss and malabsorption. Hemoglobin concentration can be used to screen for iron deficiency, whereas serum ferritin concentration can be used to confirm iron deficiency. However, the serum ferritin concentration may be elevated in patients with infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic conditions. Other tests may be needed, such as erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin concentration, transferrin concentration, serum iron concentration, and transferrin saturation. The cause of iron deficiency must be identified. If the patient is male, postmenopausal female, or has risk factors for blood loss, then the patient should be evaluated for sources of blood loss, especially gastrointestinal (eg, colon cancer). Several studies have examined the relationship between iron deficiency and hair loss. Almost all have addressed women exclusively and have focused on noncicatricial hair loss. Some suggest that iron deficiency may be related to alopecia areata, androgenetic alopecia, telogen effluvium, and diffuse hair loss, while others do not. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to recommend universal screening for iron deficiency in patients with hair loss. In addition, there is insufficient evidence to recommend giving iron supplementation therapy to patients with hair loss and iron deficiency in the absence of iron deficiency anemia. The decision to do either should be based on clinical judgment. It is our practice at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation to screen male and female patients with both cicatricial and noncicatricial hair loss for iron deficiency. Although this practice is not evidence based per se, we believe that treatment for hair loss is enhanced when iron deficiency, with or without anemia, is treated. Iron deficiency anemia should be treated. Treating iron deficiency without anemia is controversial. Treatment of nutritional iron deficiency anemia includes adequate dietary intake and oral iron supplementation.

Their photosynthetic efficiency is enhanced by concentrating CO(2) around Rubisco, diminishing photorespiration, but the mechanism is yet to be resolved. Diatoms have been regarded as C(3) photosynthesizers, but recent metabolic labeling and genome sequencing data suggest that they perform C(4) photosynthesis. We studied the pathways of photosynthetic carbon assimilation in two diatoms by short-term metabolic (14)C labeling. In Thalassiosira weissflogii, both C3 (glycerate-P and triose-P) and C4 (mainly malate) compounds were major initial (2-5 s) products, whereas Thalassiosira pseudonana produced mainly C3 and C6 (hexose-P) compounds. The data provide evidence of C(3)-C(4) intermediate photosynthesis in T. weissflogii, but exclusively C(3) photosynthesis in T. pseudonana. The labeling patterns were the same for cells grown at near-ambient (380 microL L(-1)) and low (100 microL L(-1)) CO(2) concentrations. The lack of environmental modulation of carbon assimilatory pathways was supported in T. pseudonana by measurements of gene transcript and protein abundances of C(4)-metabolic enzymes (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase) and Rubisco. This study suggests that the photosynthetic pathways of diatoms are diverse, and may involve combined CO(2)-concentrating mechanisms.

{"body":"What mechanism suppresses melatonin release in humans?","snippets":[{"text":"The daily rhythm of melatonin production in the mammalian pineal is driven by the endogenous circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nuclei. The major release period of melatonin is closely linked to the dark phase of the 24-h day\/night cycle. Environmental light will affect melatonin release in two ways: (i) it entrains the rhythm of the circadian oscillator; and (ii) it causes an acute suppression of nocturnal melatonin release. These two effects of light are both mediated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus and enable the pineal gland to convey information about day length to the reproductive system through changes in melatonin levels. Glutamate is currently believed to be the major transmitter in the retinal ganglion cell fibers reaching the suprachiasmatic nucleus. At present no information is available, however, about the transmitter(s) implicated in the further propagation, i.e. from the suprachiasmatic nucleus onwards, of the light information. In the present study we provide evidence that the endogenous release of GABA from suprachiasmatic nucleus terminals is implicated in the further transmission of light information to the pineal gland. Bilateral administration of the GABA-antagonist bicuculline to hypothalamic target areas of the suprachiasmatic nucleus completely prevents the inhibitory effect of nocturnal light on melatonin secretion and the present study thus documents that retina-mediated photic activation of suprachiasmatic nucleus neurons induces the release of GABA from efferent suprachiasmatic nucleus nerve terminals, resulting in an inhibition of melatonin release by the pineal gland. Together with our previous (electro)physiological data these results identify GABA as an important mediator of rapid synaptic transmission of suprachiasmatic nucleus output to its target areas.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10366002"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10366002"],"type":"list","exact_answer":"endogenous circadian rhythms, light exposure, and environmental factors","ideal_answer":"Overall, melatonin release in humans is tightly regulated by the interplay of endogenous circadian rhythms, light exposure, and environmental factors."}

Following the work of Newsholme and Crabtree, a quantitative theory was developed for this idea based on open-system thermodynamics and metabolic control analysis. It is shown that the stoichiometric sensitivity of an intermediary metabolite concentration with respect to changes in steady-state flux is governed by the effective equilibrium constant of the intermediate formation, and the equilibrium can be regulated by a futile cycle. The direction of the shift in the effective equilibrium constant depends on the direction of operation of the futile cycle. High stoichiometric sensitivity corresponds to ultrasensitivity of an intermediate concentration to net flow through a pathway; low stoichiometric sensitivity corresponds to super-robustness of concentration with respect to changes in flux. Both cases potentially play important roles in metabolic regulation. Futile cycles actively shift the effective equilibrium by expending energy; the magnitude of changes in effective equilibria and sensitivities is a function of the amount of energy used by a futile cycle. This proposed mechanism for control by futile cycles works remarkably similar to kinetic proofreading in biosynthesis. The sensitivity of the system is also intimately related to the rate of concentration fluctuations of intermediate metabolites. The possibility of different roles for the two major mechanisms within cellular biochemical regulation, namely reversible chemical modifications via futile cycles and shifting equilibrium by macromolecular binding, are discussed.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16986621"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16986621"],"type":"summary","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":"Overall, futile reaction cycling involving Fruc-P and Fruc-BP, as well as other metabolic pathways, can serve various physiological roles in cells, including metabolic regulation, energy dissipation, and fine-tuning of metabolic fluxes.

Human herpes simplex viruses are ubiquitous, with over two-thirds of the human population infected by at least one virus. Here, we investigated whether the additional human simplex virus is the result of ancient viral lineage duplication or cross-species transmission. We found that standard phylogenetic models of nucleotide substitution are inadequate for distinguishing among these competing hypotheses; the extent of synonymous substitutions causes a substantial underestimation of the lengths of some of the branches in the phylogeny, consistent with observations in other viruses (e.g., avian influenza, Ebola, and coronaviruses). To more accurately estimate ancient viral divergence times, we applied a branch-site random effects likelihood model of molecular evolution that allows the strength of natural selection to vary across both the viral phylogeny and the gene alignment. This selection-informed model favored a scenario in which HSV-1 is the result of ancient codivergence and HSV-2 arose from a cross-species transmission event from the ancestor of modern chimpanzees to an extinct Homo precursor of modern humans, around 1.6 Ma.

The relative effects of changes in each of these parameters on conduction velocity can be assessed from studies on fibers representing different similarity classes or from theoretical parametric studies. These studies show that for a fixed axon diameter, conduction velocity increases with myelin thickness. For a fixed total fiber diameter, there is an optimal ratio of axon diameter to total fiber diameter (and therefore to myelin thickness) at which conduction velocity is maximized. Conduction velocity is dependent on internode distance, with a broad maximum centered around the value observed in normal peripheral fibers.

Steady-state kinetic parameters of mouse liver GCL (glutamate-cysteine ligase), the rate-limiting enzyme in GSH synthesis, and levels of hepatic GSH synthesis precursors from the trans-sulfuration pathway, such as homocysteine, cystathionine and cysteine, were compared between young and old C57BL\/6 mice (6- and 24-month-old respectively). There were no agerelated differences in GCL V(max), but the apparent K(m) for its substrates, cysteine and glutamate, was higher in the old mice compared with the young mice (approximately 800 compared with approximately 300 microM, and approximately 710 compared with 450 microM, P<0.05 for cysteine and glutamate in young and old mice respectively). Amounts of cysteine, cystathionine and Cys-Gly increased with age by 91, 24 and 28% respectively. Glutathione (GSH) levels remained unchanged with age, whereas GSSG content showed an 84% increase, suggesting a significant pro-oxidizing shift in the 2GSH\/GSSG ratio. The amount of the toxic trans-sulfuration\/glutathione biosynthetic pathway intermediate, homocysteine, was 154% higher (P<0.005) in the liver of old mice compared with young mice. The conversion of homocysteine into cystathionine, a rate-limiting step in trans-sulfuration catalysed by cystathionine beta-synthase, was comparatively less efficient in the old mice, as indicated by cystathionine\/homocysteine ratios. Incubation of tissue homogenates with physiological concentrations of homocysteine caused an up to 4.4-fold increase in the apparent K(m) of GCL for its glutamate substrate, but had no effect on V(max). The results suggest that perturbation of the catalytic efficiency of GCL and accumulation of homocysteine from the trans-sulfuration pathway may adversely affect de novo GSH synthesis during aging.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17461778"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17461778"],"type":"list","exact_answer":"oxidative stress, endothelial cell injury, inflammation, eNOS dysfunction, and dysregulation of one-carbon metabolism","ideal_answer":"Overall, elevated homocysteine levels can induce endothelial dysfunction and damage through multiple mechanisms, including oxidative stress, endothelial cell injury, inflammation, eNOS dysfunction, and dysregulation of one-carbon metabolism."}

As many model species (for example, mice) are adapted to lifestyles of frequent small meals, we turned to the Burmese python, a sit-and-wait foraging snake that consumes large prey at long intervals (>1 month), to examine the effects of a dynamic nutrient milieu on the gut microbiota. We used multiplexed 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing to characterize bacterial communities harvested from the intestines of fasted and digesting snakes, and from their rodent meal. In this unprecedented survey of a reptilian host, we found that Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes numerically dominated the python gut. In the large intestine, fasting was associated with increased abundances of the genera Bacteroides, Rikenella, Synergistes and Akkermansia, and with reduced overall diversity. A marked postprandial shift in bacterial community configuration occurred. Between 12\u2009h and 3 days after feeding, Firmicutes, including the taxa Clostridium, Lactobacillus and Peptostreptococcaceae, gradually outnumbered the fasting-dominant Bacteroidetes, and overall 'species'-level diversity increased significantly. Most lineages seemed to be indigenous to the python rather than ingested with the meal, but a dietary source of Lactobacillus could not be ruled out. Thus, the observed large-scale alterations of the gut microbiota that accompany the Burmese python's own dramatic physiological and morphological changes during feeding and fasting emphasize the need to consider both microbial and host cellular responses to nutrient flux. The Burmese python may provide a unique model for dissecting these interrelationships.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20520652"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20520652"],"type":"summary","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":"Overall, oligosaccharides from legumes can positively influence the composition of intestinal flora by promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria, increasing the production of SCFAs, and enhancing gut barrier function.

{"body":"Cat purring: What are some possible underlying mechanisms behind purring and bone remodeling and formation?","snippets":[{"text":"Mechanical loading of the skeleton is necessary to maintain bone structure and strength. Large amplitude strains associated with vigorous activity typically result in the greatest osteogenic response; however, data suggest that low-amplitude, broad-frequency vibration results in new bone formation and may enhance adaptation through a stochastic resonance (SR) phenomenon. That is, random noise may maximally enhance bone formation to a known osteogenic stimulus. The aims of this study were to (1) assess the ability of different vibration signals to enhance cortical bone formation during short- and long-term loading and (2) determine whether vibration could effect SR in bone. Two studies were completed wherein several osteogenic loading waveforms, with or without an additive low-amplitude, broad-frequency (0-50 Hz) vibration signal, were applied to the mouse ulna in axial compression. In study 1, mice were loaded short-term (30 s\/day, 2 days) with either a carrier signal alone (1 or 2 N sine waveform), vibration signal alone [0.1 N or 0.3 N root mean square (RMS)] or combined carrier and vibration signal. In study 2, mice were loaded long-term (30 s\/day, 3 days\/week, 4 weeks) with a carrier signal alone (static or sine waveform), vibration signal alone (0.02 N, 0.04 N, 0.08 N or 0.25 N RMS) or combined carrier and vibration signal. Sequential calcein bone labels were administered at 2 and 4 days and at 4 and 29 days after the first day of loading in study 1 and 2, respectively; bone formation parameters and changes in geometry were measured. Combined application of the carrier and vibration signals in study 1 resulted in significantly greater bone formation than with either signal alone (P < 0.001); however, this increase was independently explained by increased strain levels associated with additive vibration. When load and strain levels were similar across loading groups in study 2, cortical bone formation and changes in geometry were not significantly altered by vibration. Vibration alone did not result in any new bone formation. Our data suggest that low-amplitude, broad-frequency vibration superimposed onto an osteogenic waveform or vibration alone does not enhance cortical bone adaptation at the frequencies, amplitudes and loading periods tested.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16793358"},{"text":"Short durations of extremely small magnitude, high-frequency, mechanical stimuli can promote anabolic activity in the adult skeleton. Here, it is determined if such signals can influence trabecular and cortical formative and resorptive activity in the growing skeleton, if the newly formed bone is of high quality, and if the insertion of rest periods during the loading phase would enhance the efficacy of the mechanical regimen. Eight-week-old female BALB\/cByJ mice were divided into four groups, baseline control (n = 8), age-matched control (n = 10), whole-body vibration (WBV) at 45 Hz (0.3 g) for 15 min day(-1) (n = 10), and WBV that were interrupted every second by 10 of rest (WBV-R, n = 10). In vivo strain gaging of two additional mice indicated that the mechanical signal induced strain oscillations of approximately 10 microstrain on the periosteal surface of the proximal tibia. After 3 weeks of WBV, applied for 15 min each day, osteoclastic activity in the trabecular metaphysis and epiphysis of the tibia was 33% and 31% lower (P <0.05) than in age-matched controls. Bone formation rates (BFR.BS(-1)) on the endocortical surface of the metaphysis were 30% greater (P <0.05) in WBV than in age-matched control mice but trabecular and middiaphyseal BFR were not significantly altered. The insertion of rest periods (WBV-R) failed to potentiate the cellular effects. Three weeks of either WBV or WBV-R did not negatively influence body mass, bone length, or chemical bone matrix properties of the tibia. These data indicate that in the growing skeleton, short daily periods of extremely small, high-frequency mechanical signals can inhibit trabecular bone resorption, site specifically attenuate the declining levels of bone formation, and maintain a high level of matrix quality. If WBV prove to be efficacious in the growing human skeleton, they may be able to provide the basis for a non-pharmacological and safe means to increase peak bone mass and, ultimately, reduce the incidence of osteoporosis or stress fractures later in life.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16824816"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16793358","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16824816"],"type":"summary","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":"In summary, cat purring is a complex behavior with multiple possible underlying mechanisms, including communication, social bonding, stress reduction, and potential therapeutic effects on the body.

We cover here thin and thick filament structure, the molecular basis of force generation and its regulation, and two special properties of some invertebrate muscle, catch and asynchronous muscle. Invertebrate thin filaments resemble vertebrate thin filaments, although helix structure and tropomyosin arrangement show small differences. Invertebrate thick filaments, alternatively, are very different from vertebrate striated thick filaments and show great variation within invertebrates. Part of this diversity stems from variation in paramyosin content, which is greatly increased in very large diameter invertebrate thick filaments. Other of it arises from relatively small changes in filament backbone structure, which results in filaments with grossly similar myosin head placements (rotating crowns of heads every 14.5 nm) but large changes in detail (distances between heads in azimuthal registration varying from three to thousands of crowns). The lever arm basis of force generation is common to both vertebrates and invertebrates, and in some invertebrates this process is understood on the near atomic level. Invertebrate actomyosin is both thin (tropomyosin:troponin) and thick (primarily via direct Ca(++) binding to myosin) filament regulated, and most invertebrate muscles are dually regulated. These mechanisms are well understood on the molecular level, but the behavioral utility of dual regulation is less so. The phosphorylation state of the thick filament associated giant protein, twitchin, has been recently shown to be the molecular basis of catch.

A French mineral water, containing calcium and magnesium (202 and 36 ppm, respectively) was selected as the dietary vehicle. Twenty calcium oxalate stone-forming patients of each sex as well as 20 healthy volunteers of each sex participated in the study.

In addition, 24-hour urines were collected by each subject on their free diets. The entire cycle was repeated at least twice by each subject. Several risk factors (excretion of oxalate; relative supersaturations of calcium oxalate, brushite and uric acid; calcium oxalate metastable limit; oxalate:magnesium ratio and oxalate:metastable limit ratio) were favourably altered by the mineral water and tap water regimens but the former was more effective.

However, the activation and inactivation of such a \"low-energy-cost neuron\" turns out to be extremely sensitive to small fluctuation of Na(+) currents associated with Na(+)-dependent secondary-active transport that is indispensable for the metabolic integrity of the cell and neurotransmitter recycling.

The structure reveals a rigid coupling between the peptide binding and the E2 binding domains and a conserved surface channel leading from the peptide to the E2 active site, suggesting that RING E3s may function as scaffolds that position the substrate and the E2 optimally for ubiquitin transfer.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10966114"},{"text":"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an essential organelle involved in many cellular functions including protein folding and secretion, lipid biosynthesis and calcium homeostasis. Proteins destined for the cell surface or for secretion are made in the ER, where they are folded and assembled into multi-subunit complexes. The ER plays a vital role in cellular protein quality control by extracting and degrading proteins that are not correctly folded or assembled into native complexes. This process, known as ER-associated degradation (ERAD), ensures that only properly folded and assembled proteins are transported to their final destinations. Besides its role in protein folding and transport in the secretory pathway, the ER regulates the biosynthesis of cholesterol and other membrane lipids. ERAD is an important means to ensure that levels of the responsible enzymes are appropriately maintained. The ER is also a major organelle for oxygen and nutrient sensing as cells adapt to their microenvironment. Stresses that disrupt ER function leads to accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER, a condition known as ER stress. Cells adapt to ER stress by activating an integrated signal transduction pathway called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (1). The UPR represents a survival response by the cells to restore ER homeostasis. If ER stress persists, cells activate mechanisms that result in cell death. Chronic ER stress is increasingly being recognized as a factor in many human diseases such as diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. In this review we discuss the roles of the UPR and ERAD in cancer and suggest directions for future research.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21331300"},{"text":"Protein quality control (PQC) is essential to intracellular proteostasis and is carried out by sophisticated collaboration between molecular chaperones and targeted protein degradation.

Ubiquitination and subsequently ubiquitin (Ub) receptor proteins (e.g., p62 and ubiquilins) are important common factors for targeting misfolded proteins to multiple quality control destinies, including the proteasome, lysosomes, and perhaps aggresomes, as well as for triggering mitophagy to remove defective mitochondria. PQC inadequacy, particularly proteasome functional insufficiency, has been shown to participate in cardiac pathogenesis.

Association analysis of the haplotype in the combined sample of both AGRE data sets (389 families) produced a P value of .0000033, whereas combining all three data sets (518 families) produced a P value of .00000035. Population-attributable risk calculations for the associated haplotype, performed using the entire sample of 518 families, determined that the risk allele contributes to as many as 40% of ASD cases in the general population. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) mapping with the use of polymorphisms distributed throughout the gene has shown that only intronic SNPs are in strong LD with rs1861972 and rs1861973.

In children with ASD, the prevalence of FRAs and the response to leucovorin in FRA-positive children has not been systematically investigated. In this study, serum FRA concentrations were measured in 93 children with ASD and a high prevalence (75.3%) of FRAs was found. In 16 children, the concentration of blocking FRA significantly correlated with cerebrospinal fluid 5-methyltetrahydrofolate concentrations, which were below the normative mean in every case. Children with FRAs were treated with oral leucovorin calcium (2\u2009mg\u2009kg(-1) per day; maximum 50\u2009mg per day). Treatment response was measured and compared with a wait-list control group. Compared with controls, significantly higher improvement ratings were observed in treated children over a mean period of 4 months in verbal communication, receptive and expressive language, attention and stereotypical behavior. Approximately one-third of treated children demonstrated moderate to much improvement. The incidence of adverse effects was low. This study suggests that FRAs may be important in ASD and that FRA-positive children with ASD may benefit from leucovorin calcium treatment.

{"body":"Will eukaryotic RNA fold in the same way in prokaryotes?","snippets":[{"text":"The stabilization of RNA tertiary structures by ions is well known, but the neutral osmolyte trimethylamine oxide (TMAO) can also effectively stabilize RNA tertiary structure. To begin to understand the physical basis for the effects of TMAO on RNA, we have quantitated the TMAO-induced stabilization of five RNAs with known structures. So-called m values, the increment in unfolding free energy per molal of osmolyte at constant KCl activity, are \u223c0 for a hairpin secondary structure and between 0.70 and 1.85\u00a0kcal mol(-1)m(-1) for four RNA tertiary structures (30-86\u00a0nt). Further analysis of two RNAs by small-angle X-ray scattering and hydroxyl radical probing shows that TMAO reduces the radius of gyration of the unfolded ensemble to the same endpoint as seen in titration with Mg(2+) and that the structures stabilized by TMAO and Mg(2+) are indistinguishable. Remarkably, TMAO induces the native conformation of a Mg(2+) ion chelation site formed in part by a buried phosphate, even though Mg(2+) is absent. TMAO interacts weakly, if at all, with KCl, ruling out the possibility that TMAO stabilizes RNA indirectly by increasing salt activity.

Omnivorous human subjects produced more TMAO than did vegans or vegetarians following ingestion of L-carnitine through a microbiota-dependent mechanism. The presence of specific bacterial taxa in human feces was associated with both plasma TMAO concentration and dietary status. Plasma L-carnitine levels in subjects undergoing cardiac evaluation (n = 2,595) predicted increased risks for both prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD) and incident major adverse cardiac events (myocardial infarction, stroke or death), but only among subjects with concurrently high TMAO levels. Chronic dietary L-carnitine supplementation in mice altered cecal microbial composition, markedly enhanced synthesis of TMA and TMAO, and increased atherosclerosis, but this did not occur if intestinal microbiota was concurrently suppressed. In mice with an intact intestinal microbiota, dietary supplementation with TMAO or either carnitine or choline reduced in vivo reverse cholesterol transport. Intestinal microbiota may thus contribute to the well-established link between high levels of red meat consumption and CVD risk.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23563705"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20875423","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23563705"],"type":"yesno","exact_answer":"no","ideal_answer":"The folding of eukaryotic RNA in prokaryotes may not necessarily occur in the same way as it does in its native eukaryotic environment.

{"body":"Advantage of being deuterostome","snippets":[{"text":"Interest in understanding the transition from prevertebrates to vertebrates at the molecular level has resulted in accumulating genomic and transcriptomic sequence data for the earliest groups of extant vertebrates, namely, hagfishes (Myxiniformes) and lampreys (Petromyzontiformes). Molecular phylogenetic studies on species phylogeny have revealed the monophyly of cyclostomes and the deep divergence between hagfishes and lampreys (more than 400 million years). In parallel, recent molecular phylogenetic studies have shed light on the complex evolution of the cyclostome genome. This consists of whole genome duplications, shared at least partly with gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates), and cyclostome lineage-specific secondary modifications of the genome, such as gene gains and losses. Therefore, the analysis of cyclostome genomes requires caution in distinguishing between orthology and paralogy in gene molecular phylogeny at the gene family scale, as well as between apomorphic and plesiomorphic genomic traits in larger-scale analyses. In this review, we propose possible ways of improving the resolvability of these evolutionary events, and discuss probable scenarios for cyclostome genome evolution, with special emphasis on the hypothesis that two-round (2R) genome duplication events occurred before the divergence between cyclostomes and gnathostomes, and therefore that a post-2R state is a genomic synapomorphy for all extant vertebrates.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19267631"},{"text":"Gene constellations on several human chromosomes are interpreted as indications of large regional duplications that took place during evolution of the vertebrate genome.

Recent studies have provided new insights into when, where and how these different classes of cell arise during CNS development. The founder cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage initially arise in distinct regions of the ventricular zone during early development as the result of local signals including sonic hedgehog. In the spinal cord, oligodendrocyte precursors appear to share a developmental lineage with motor neurons, although they may also develop from restricted glial precursors. Immature oligodendrocyte precursors are highly migratory. They migrate from their site of origin to developing white matter tracts using a variety of guidance cues including diffusible chemorepellents. The majority of oligodendrocyte precursor proliferation occurs in developing white matter as a result of the local expression of mitogenic signals. Oligodendrocyte precursor cell proliferation is regulated by a number of distinct growth factors that act at distinct stages in the lineage and whose activity is modulated by synergy with other molecules including chemokines. The final matching of oligodendrocyte and axon number is accomplished through a combination of local regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation and cell death. Not all oligodendrocyte precursors differentiate during development, and the adult CNS contains a significant population of precursors.

{"body":"Why is AUG the initiation codon?","snippets":[{"text":"The mechanisms whereby ribosomes engage a messenger RNA and select the start site for translation differ between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Initiation sites in polycistronic prokaryotic mRNAs are usually selected via base pairing with ribosomal RNA. That straightforward mechanism is made complicated and interesting by cis- and trans-acting elements employed to regulate translation. Initiation sites in eukaryotic mRNAs are reached via a scanning mechanism which predicts that translation should start at the AUG codon nearest the 5' end of the mRNA. Interest has focused on mechanisms that occasionally allow escape from this first-AUG rule. With natural mRNAs, three escape mechanisms - context-dependent leaky scanning, reinitiation, and possibly direct internal initiation - allow access to AUG codons which, although not first, are still close to the 5' end of the mRNA. This constraint on the initiation step of translation in eukaryotes dictates the location of transcriptional promoters and may have contributed to the evolution of splicing.The binding of Met-tRNA to ribosomes is mediated by a GTP-binding protein in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, but the more complex structure of the eukaryotic factor (eIF-2) and its association with other proteins underlie some aspects of initiation unique to eukaryotes. Modulation of GTP hydrolysis by eIF-2 is important during the scanning phase of initiation, while modulating the release of GDP from eIF-2 is a key mechanism for regulating translation in eukaryotes. Our understanding of how some other protein factors participate in the initiation phase of translation is in flux. Genetic tests suggest that some proteins conventionally counted as eukaryotic initiation factors may not be required for translation, while other tests have uncovered interesting new candidates. Some popular ideas about the initiation pathway are predicated on static interactions between isolated factors and mRNA. The need for functional testing of these complexes is discussed. Interspersed with these theoretical topics are some practical points concerning the interpretation of cDNA sequences and the use of in vitro translation systems. Some human diseases resulting from defects in the initiation step of translation are also discussed.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10395892"},{"text":"Valuable information on translation initiation is available from biochemical data and recently solved structures.

Subsequent sections describe the structure, function, and interactions of the mRNA, the initiator tRNA, and the initiation factors IF1, IF2, and IF3. Finally, we provide an overview of mechanisms of regulation of the translation initiation event. Translation occurs on ribonucleoprotein complexes called ribosomes. The ribosome is composed of a large subunit and a small subunit that hold the activities of peptidyltransfer and decode the triplet code of the mRNA, respectively. Translation initiation is promoted by IF1, IF2, and IF3, which mediate base pairing of the initiator tRNA anticodon to the mRNA initiation codon located in the ribosomal P-site. The mechanism of translation initiation differs for canonical and leaderless mRNAs, since the latter is dependent on the relative level of the initiation factors. Regulation of translation occurs primarily in the initiation phase. Secondary structures at the mRNA ribosomal binding site (RBS) inhibit translation initiation. The accessibility of the RBS is regulated by temperature and binding of small metabolites, proteins, or antisense RNAs. The future challenge is to obtain atomic-resolution structures of complete initiation complexes in order to understand the mechanism of translation initiation in molecular detail.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15755955"},{"text":"The initiator tRNA must serve functions distinct from those of other tRNAs, evading binding to elongation factors and instead binding directly to the ribosomal P site with the aid of initiation factors.

The well-documented intracellular accumulation of these two amino acids results from the low-substrate specificity of the branched-chain amino acid biosynthetic enzymes that act over a number of related \u03b1-ketoacids. The lack of absolute substrate specificity of leucyl-tRNA synthase leads to a mischarged norvalyl-tRNA(Leu) that evades the translational proofreading activities and produces norvaline-containing proteins, (cf. Apostol et al. J Biol Chem 272:28980-28988, 1997). A similar situation explains the presence of minute but detectable amounts of norleucine in place of methionine. Since with few exceptions both leucine and methionine are rarely found in the catalytic sites of most enzymes, their substitution by norvaline and norleucine, respectively, would have not been strongly hindered in small structurally simple catalytic polypeptides during the early stages of biological evolution. The report that down-shifts of free oxygen lead to high levels of intracellular accumulation of pyruvate and the subsequent biosynthesis of norvaline (Soini et al.

The processes of tRNAi evolution, and selection of methionine as the universal initiating amino acid remain an enigmatic problem. We constructed phylogenetic trees using the whole sequence, the acceptor-T\u03c8C arm ('minihelix'), and the anticodon-dihydrouridine arm regions of tRNAi from 158 species belonging to all 3 domains of life. All the trees distinctly assembled into 3 domains of life. Large trees, generated using data for all the tRNAs of a vast number of species, fail to reveal the major evolutionary events and identity of the probable elongator tRNA sequences that could be ancestor of tRNAi. Therefore, we constructed trees using the minihelix or the whole sequence of species specific tRNAs, and iterated our analysis on 50 eubacterial species. We identified tRNA(Pro), tRNA(Glu), or tRNA(Thr) (but surprisingly not elongator tRNA(Met)) as probable ancestors of tRNAi. We then determined the factors imposing selection of methionine as the initiating amino acid. Overall frequency of occurrence of methionine, whose metabolic cost of synthesis is the highest among all amino acids, remains almost unchanged across the 3 domains of life. Our correlation analysis shows that its high metabolic cost is independent of many physicochemical properties of the side chain.

During heterologous protein expression, low expression or formation of insoluble aggregates may be attributable to differences in synonymous codon usage between expression and natural hosts. This discordance may be particularly important during translation of the domain boundaries (link\/end segments) that separate elements of higher ordered structure. Within such regions, ribosomal progression slows as the ribosome encounters clusters of infrequently used codons that preferentially encode a subset of amino acids. To replicate the modulation of such localized translation rates during heterologous expression, we used known relationships between codon usage frequencies and secondary protein structure to develop an algorithm (\"codon harmonization\") for identifying regions of slowly translated mRNA that are putatively associated with link\/end segments. It then recommends synonymous replacement codons having usage frequencies in the heterologous expression host that are less than or equal to the usage frequencies of native codons in the native expression host. For protein regions other than these putative link\/end segments, it recommends synonymous substitutions with codons having usage frequencies matched as nearly as possible to the native expression system. Previous application of this algorithm facilitated E. coli expression, manufacture and testing of two Plasmodium falciparum vaccine candidates. Here we describe the algorithm in detail and apply it to E. coli expression of three additional P. falciparum proteins. Expression of the \"recoded\" genes exceeded that of the native genes by 4- to 1,000-fold, representing levels suitable for vaccine manufacture. The proteins were soluble and reacted with a variety of functional conformation-specific mAbs suggesting that they were folded properly and had assumed native conformation.

Here, we show that profound and functionally beneficial alterations on the encoded protein level were causative for the AUA codon reassignment from isoleucine to methionine observed in most mitochondrial lineages. We demonstrate that this codon reassignment leads to a massive accumulation of the easily oxidized amino acid methionine in the highly oxidative inner mitochondrial membrane. This apparently paradoxical outcome can yet be smoothly settled if the antioxidant surface chemistry of methionine is taken into account, and we present direct experimental evidence that intramembrane accumulation of methionine exhibits antioxidant and cytoprotective properties in living cells.

These theories are not mutually exclusive and are also compatible with the frozen accident hypothesis, that is, the notion that the standard code might have no special properties but was fixed simply because all extant life forms share a common ancestor, with subsequent changes to the code, mostly, precluded by the deleterious effect of codon reassignment. Mathematical analysis of the structure and possible evolutionary trajectories of the code shows that it is highly robust to translational misreading but there are numerous more robust codes, so the standard code potentially could evolve from a random code via a short sequence of codon series reassignments. Thus, much of the evolution that led to the standard code could be a combination of frozen accident with selection for error minimization although contributions from coevolution of the code with metabolic pathways and weak affinities between amino acids and nucleotide triplets cannot be ruled out. However, such scenarios for the code evolution are based on formal schemes whose relevance to the actual primordial evolution is uncertain.

A compilation of data on genomic GC content and optimal growth temperature for numerous prokaryotes failed to demonstrate the predicted correlation. By contrast, the GC content of Structural RNAs is higher at high temperatures. The issue that we address here is whether more freely evolving sites in exons (i.e. codonic third positions) evolve in the same manner as genomic DNA as a whole, Showing no correlated response, or like structural RNAs showing a strong correlation. The latter pattern would provide strong support for the thermal adaptation hypothesis, as the variation in GC content between orthologous genes is typically most profoundly seen at codon third sites (GC3).

Our study fills an important gap in mammalian developmental studies by identifying functional pathways involved in this critical but previously not studied period. Our study also revealed that the genes involved here are distinct from those during early embryogenesis, which include three groups of maternal genes. Furthermore, we discovered that genes in a given developmental process are regulated coordinately. This led us to develop an easily searchable database of this entire collection of gene expression profiles, allowing for the identification new genes important for a particular developmental process\/pathway and deducing the potential function of a novel gene. The validity of the predictions from the database was demonstrated with two examples through spatiotemporal analyses of the two novel genes.

Since cystic kidney disease is caused by mutations of ciliary proteins and cilia act as flow sensors in the kidney, we examined three polarized events in Madin Darby Canine Kidney cells under flow: cell division, cell migration, and centriole movement. We found that the mitotic orientation of dividing cells was not affected by flow and was randomly distributed in relation to the direction of the flow. Flow did not alter the direction and speed of cell migration in a wound-healing assay. However, flow resulted in increased motility of centrioles and biased centrioles to move along the axis of the flow. This effect was lost after flow-induced calcium signaling was abolished by a mutant polycystin 2.

{"body":"How is the mRNA transported out of the endoplasmic reticulum?","snippets":[{"text":"The partitioning of secretory and membrane protein-encoding mRNAs to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and their translation on ER-associated ribosomes, governs access to the secretory\/exocytic pathways of the cell. As mRNAs encoding secretory and membrane proteins comprise approximately 30% of the transcriptome, the localization of mRNAs to the ER represents an extraordinarily prominent, ubiquitous, and yet poorly understood RNA localization phenomenon.The partitioning of mRNAs to the ER is generally thought to be achieved by the signal recognition particle (SRP) pathway. In this pathway, mRNA localization to the ER is determined by the translation product - translation yields an N-terminal signal sequence or a topogenic signal that is recognized by the SRP and the resulting mRNA-ribosome-SRP complex is then recruited to the ER membrane. Recent studies have demonstrated that mRNAs can be localized to the ER via a signal sequence and\/or translation-independent pathway(s) and that discrete sets of cytosolic protein-encoding mRNAs are enriched on the ER membrane, though they lack an encoded signal sequence. These key findings reopen investigations into the mechanism(s) that govern mRNA localization to the ER. In this contribution, we describe two independent methods that can be utilized to study this important and poorly understood aspect of eukaryotic cell biology. These methods comprise two independent means of fractionating tissue culture cells to yield free\/cytosolic polyribosomes and ER membrane-bound polyribosomes.

Ten young Japanese females were housed in the same facility and given the same daily living activity schedule for 7 d. The composition of their purified diet was conformed to the Dietary Reference Intakes in Japan. The diet was niacin free.

One mechanism of cell-cell interaction is via direct cell-cell communication via gap junctions. These are transmembrane channels that allow continuity of cytoplasms between communicating cells. The biologic importance of connexin43 (Cx43), the most abundant gap junction protein in the skeleton is demonstrated by the skeletal malformations present in oculodentodigital dysplasia (ODDD), a disease linked to Cx43 gene (GJA1) mutations, and by the low bone mass and osteoblast dysfunction in Gja1 ablated mice. The presence of Cx43 is required for osteoblast differentiation and function, and by forming either gap junctions or \"hemichannels\" Cx43 allows participation of cell networks to responses to extracellular stimuli, via propagation of specific signals converging upon connexin sensitive transcriptional units. Hence, Cx43 is involved in skeletal responsiveness to anabolic signals, as those provided by parathyroid hormone and physical load, the latter function probably involving osteocyte-osteoblast communication.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18424255"},{"text":"In order for osteocytes to perceive mechanical information and regulate bone remodeling accordingly they must be anchored to their extracellular matrix (ECM). To date the nature of this attachment is not understood. Osteocytes are embedded in mineralized bone matrix, but maintain a pericellular space (50-80 nm) to facilitate fluid flow and transport of metabolites. This provides a spatial limit for their attachment to bone matrix. Integrins are cell adhesion proteins that may play a role in osteocyte attachment. However, integrin attachments require proximity between the ECM, cell membrane, and cytoskeleton, which conflicts with the osteocytes requirement for a pericellular fluid space. In this study, we hypothesize that the challenge for osteocytes to attach to surrounding bone matrix, while also maintaining fluid-filled pericellular space, requires different \"engineering\" solutions than in other tissues that are not similarly constrained. Using novel rapid fixation techniques, to improve cell membrane and matrix protein preservation, and transmission electron microscopy, the attachment of osteocyte processes to their canalicular boundaries are quantified. We report that the canalicular wall is wave-like with periodic conical protrusions extending into the pericellular space. By immunohistochemistry we identify that the integrin alphavbeta3 may play a role in attachment at these complexes; a punctate pattern of staining of beta3 along the canalicular wall was consistent with observations of periodic protrusions extending into the pericellular space.

These cells have the behaviour and potential of bonafide cardiac stem cells (CSCs): they are clonogenic, self-renewing and multipotent. Their presence has identified myocyte death and myocyte renewal as the two sides of the proverbial coin of cardiac homeostasis. Myocyte renewal depends on the differentiation of the CSCs into immature myocytes that divide two to four times before becoming terminally differentiated. Both in vivo and in vitro the progeny of a single CSC can generate the three major cell types of the myocardium: myocytes, smooth muscle and endothelial vascular cells. More interestingly, when directly injected or activated with growth factors in the post-ischaemic myocardium, these cells are able to reconstitute a functional ventricular wall.

Sex differences in the brain are largely determined by steroid hormone exposure during a perinatal sensitive period that alters subsequent hormonal and nonhormonal responses throughout the lifespan. Steroid receptors are members of a nuclear receptor transcription factor superfamily and recruit multiple proteins that possess enzymatic activity relevant to epigenetic changes such as acetylation and methylation. Thus steroid hormones are uniquely poised to exert epigenetic effects on the developing nervous system to dictate adult sex differences in brain and behavior. Sex differences in the methylation pattern in the promoter of estrogen and progesterone receptor genes are evident in newborns and persist in adults but with a different pattern. Changes in response to injury and in methyl-binding proteins and steroid receptor coregulatory proteins are also reported. Many steroid-induced epigenetic changes are opportunistic and restricted to a single lifespan, but new evidence suggests endocrine-disrupting compounds can exert multigenerational effects. Similarly, maternal diet also induces transgenerational effects, but the impact is sex specific.

{"body":"Growth Hormone and diabetes","snippets":[{"text":"The insulin and growth hormone (GH)\/insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) axis are two endocrine systems that are interlinked at many levels. GH is one of the glucose counter-regulatory hormones, rising in response to hypoglycaemia, it has both intrinsic hyperglycaemic actions and causes insulin resistance. Both IGF-I and its receptor have high structural and functional homology to insulin and its receptor. Insulin can regulate IGF-I production, acting on the GH receptor or at a post-receptor site. Conversely IGF-I is thought to have a permissive effect on the pancreatic insulin response to glucose. Growth is compromised in poorly controlled diabetic children; however, a causal link with altered GH\/IGF-I levels has not been proven. Insulin-dependent diabetes clearly causes derangements in the GH\/IGF-I axis. In poorly controlled diabetics GH levels are invariably raised whilst normal or low levels of IGF-I are found, indicating a dissociation between the two factors. Altered IGF-binding protein levels are also found, with high levels of small binding protein and low levels of large binding protein. These derangements are probably the result of interactions at many levels although the exact mechanisms are not fully understood. Raised GH levels could result from altered hypothalamic\/pituitary control or reduced feedback inhibition. The latter could, in turn, result from low IGF-I levels, reduced availability of IGF-I to relevant receptors or increased levels of inhibitors (possibly the small binding protein). Low IGF-I levels could be directly due to deficient insulin levels or simply to lack of available circulating binding protein. Alternative or altered molecular forms of circulating GH in diabetes seem unlikely on present evidence. That GH has an effect on glycaemic control is most evident from the abnormal glucose tolerance seen in acromegalics, but is also seen with physiological GH variations such as during the pubertal growth spurt. In diabetics the derangements to the GH\/IGF-I axis, caused by poor metabolic control, leads to aggravation of the metabolic problems. Altered GH\/IGF-I levels have been implicated in the long-term complications associated with diabetes, and whilst GH\/IGF-I are not essential for the early changes involved in these complications they may still play an important role in their development, especially proliferative retinopathy.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3053958"},{"text":"The diabetogenic action of pituitary extracts containing growth hormone has been recognised for more than 60 years and the importance of growth hormone in the development and progression of diabetic retinopathy for more than 30 years. Hypophysectomy was the first effective treatment for retinopathy but was discontinued because of the risk of severe hypoglycaemia that it produced and the development of an alternative, less dangerous therapy--photocoagulation. The precise role and significance of growth hormone in diabetes care, however, remains to this day a mystery. The fact that modern, highly purified biosynthetic preparations of growth hormone still retain full diabetogenic potency and the fact that diabetes develops in up to 25% of patients with acromegaly indicate growth hormone's potential for involvement in the aetiology of diabetes mellitus, although most will agree that this is not likely to be an important factor in the large majority of 'idiopathic' cases. There is strong evidence to indicate a substantial hypersecretion of growth hormone in 'idiopathic' diabetes mellitus (particularly insulin-dependent cases and those with retinopathy), which appears to be more related to residual pancreatic insulin secretion than to metabolic control. Since the advent of biosynthetic growth hormone in sufficient quantity to perform trials in adults, we are more aware of growth hormone's considerable potency in the regulation of body composition, growth factor production and intermediary metabolism. In this article, we review the literature and, from this and our own work, propose a new hypothesis which links the hypersecretion of growth hormone to reduced hepatic secretion of insulin-like growth-factor I (IGF-I) as a direct result of reduced portal insulin levels in diabetes mellitus. The hypersecretion of growth hormone exposes peripheral organs such as the retina and kidney to conditions favouring the expression of growth-hormone-dependent growth factors such as IGF-I which may contribute to the development of diabetic microvascular disease by autocrine and\/or paracrine effects. If this hypothesis proves to be true, it offers new opportunities for the prevention of diabetic microvascular complications through suppression of growth hormone secretion which in turn will increase insulin sensitivity and facilitate good glycaemic control.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8300053"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3053958","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8300053"],"type":"summary","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":"In summary, the connection between growth hormone and diabetes involves complex interactions between GH secretion, insulin sensitivity, and glucose metabolism.

Their average mutation rates per base pair vary by approximately 16,000-fold, whereas their mutation rates per genome vary by only approximately 2.5-fold, apparently randomly, around a mean value of 0.0033 per DNA replication. The average mutation rate per base pair is inversely proportional to genome size. Therefore, a nearly invariant microbial mutation rate appears to have evolved. Because this rate is uniform in such diverse organisms, it is likely to be determined by deep general forces, perhaps by a balance between the usually deleterious effects of mutation and the physiological costs of further reducing mutation rates.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1831267"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1831267"],"type":"summary","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":"In summary, there is a general trend of a positive correlation between genome size and mutation rate, with larger genomes often exhibiting higher mutation rates.

{"body":"Why is ATP the preferred choice for energy carriers?","snippets":[{"text":"Phosphoryl transfer plays key roles in signaling, energy transduction, protein synthesis, and maintaining the integrity of the genetic material. On the surface, it would appear to be a simple nucleophile displacement reaction. However, this simplicity is deceptive, as, even in aqueous solution, the low-lying d-orbitals on the phosphorus atom allow for eight distinct mechanistic possibilities, before even introducing the complexities of the enzyme catalyzed reactions. To further complicate matters, while powerful, traditional experimental techniques such as the use of linear free-energy relationships (LFER) or measuring isotope effects cannot make unique distinctions between different potential mechanisms. A quarter of a century has passed since Westheimer wrote his seminal review, 'Why Nature Chose Phosphate' (Science 235 (1987), 1173), and a lot has changed in the field since then. The present review revisits this biologically crucial issue, exploring both relevant enzymatic systems as well as the corresponding chemistry in aqueous solution, and demonstrating that the only way key questions in this field are likely to be resolved is through careful theoretical studies (which of course should be able to reproduce all relevant experimental data). Finally, we demonstrate that the reason that nature really chose phosphate is due to interplay between two counteracting effects: on the one hand, phosphates are negatively charged and the resulting charge-charge repulsion with the attacking nucleophile contributes to the very high barrier for hydrolysis, making phosphate esters among the most inert compounds known. However, biology is not only about reducing the barrier to unfavorable chemical reactions. That is, the same charge-charge repulsion that makes phosphate ester hydrolysis so unfavorable also makes it possible to regulate, by exploiting the electrostatics. This means that phosphate ester hydrolysis can not only be turned on, but also be turned off, by fine tuning the electrostatic environment and the present review demonstrates numerous examples where this is the case. Without this capacity for regulation, it would be impossible to have for instance a signaling or metabolic cascade, where the action of each participant is determined by the fine-tuned activity of the previous piece in the production line. This makes phosphate esters the ideal compounds to facilitate life as we know it.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23318152"},{"text":"Phosphate esters and anhydrides dominate the living world but are seldom used as intermediates by organic chemists.

A similar explanation for stability and retention also holds for phosphates that are intermediary metabolites and for phosphates that serve as energy sources. Phosphates with multiple negative charges can react by way of the monomeric metaphosphate ion PO3- as an intermediate. No other residue appears to fulfill the multiple roles of phosphate in biochemistry. Stable, negatively charged phosphates react under catalysis by enzymes; organic chemists, who can only rarely use enzymatic catalysis for their reactions, need more highly reactive intermediates than phosphates.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2434996"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23318152","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2434996"],"type":"list","exact_answer":"high energy content, universality, rapid turnover, regeneration capability, ability to couple reactions, and modularity","ideal_answer":"ATP is the preferred choice for energy carriers in biological systems due to its high energy content, universality, rapid turnover, regeneration capability, ability to couple reactions, and modularity"}

Mitochondrial DNA codifies a small, but essential number of polypeptides of the oxidative phosphorylation system. The mammalian mitochondrial genome is an example of extreme economy showing a compact gene organization. The coding sequences for two ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), 22 transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and 13 polypeptides are contiguous and without introns. The tRNAs are regularly interspersed between the rRNA and protein-coding genes, playing a crucial role in RNA maturation from the polycistronic transcripts. A single major non-coding region, called the D-loop region, contains the main regulatory sequences for transcription and replication initiation. This genetic organization has its precise correspondence in the mode of expression and distinctive structural features of the RNAs. The basic mechanisms of mitochondrial DNA transcription and replication and the main cis-acting elements playing a role in both processes have been determined. Many trans-acting factors involved in mitochondrial gene expression, including the RNA and DNA polymerases, have been cloned or identified. However, the regulatory mechanisms participating in mitochondrial gene expression are still poorly understood. The interest to complete this knowledge is increased by the involvement of mitochondria in human diseases, in basic processes such as heat production, Ca(2+) homeostasis and apoptosis, and by their potential role in ageing and carcinogenesis.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12525854"},{"text":"Since the isolation and physical characterization of mammalian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) over 35 years ago, numerous works have been published that have examined its physical structure and properties, including its mode of replication and transcription. The established replication model posits that leading-strand replication of mammalian mtDNA begins at closely spaced, defined sites located downstream from a major transcription promoter and proceeds unidirectionally with displacement of the parental leading strand until approximately two-thirds of the closed circular mtDNA has been copied. As a consequence, the replication fork passes a major origin for lagging-strand synthesis, exposing it in single-stranded form. Displacement as a single-strand is thought to allow the characteristic secondary structure of this origin to occur, thereby permitting initiation of lagging-strand synthesis. A natural consequence of the separate and distinct locations of the two origins is that the two segregated progeny mtDNA circles are of two types: one a duplex circle with a newly synthesized leading strand and the other a gapped circle with a partial newly synthesized lagging strand. In each case, the final steps of synthesis and ligation result in closed circular mtDNA products. Recently, mammalian mtDNA isolates have been subjected to 2D-gel electrophoretic analysis in attempts to assign features to mtDNA molecules that, by virtue of their anomalous migration behavior, could infer them to be candidates for replication intermediates.

Although these comparisons are useful, more detailed thermodynamic analyses are required to reach a more complete understanding of the mechanisms thermophilic protein employ to remain folded over a wider range of temperatures. This complete thermodynamic description allows one to generate a stability curve for a protein that defines how the conformational stability (DeltaG) varies with temperature. Here we compare stability curves for many pairs of homologous proteins from thermophilic and mesophilc organisms.

{"body":"Why is there more variation in proteins than genes?","snippets":[{"text":"The number of mRNAs and proteins that can be produced from a single gene is known to be increased by the number of start sites and by multiple splicing of products. A few genes have been found to generate extraordinarily large numbers of splicing isoforms. In the human, the largest number, nearly 2000 mRNA isoforms, has been reported for the neurexin 3alpha gene. However, the biological significance of alternative splicing often remains unclear because many alternative transcripts contain early translational stops and are thought to be rapidly degraded. We demonstrate here that human basonuclin 2 (bn2; approved gene symbol BNC2) transcripts are initiated from six promoters, are alternatively spliced at multiple positions, and are polyadenylated at four sites. Characterization of nearly 100 bn2 mRNA isoforms suggests that each promoter, splice site, and poly(A) addition site is used independently. The bn2 gene has therefore the potential to generate up to 90,000 mRNA isoforms encoding more than 2000 different proteins. Because alternative exons affect the position of the first methionine codon, the length of the coding region, and the position of the translational stop, the encoded proteins range in size from 43 to 1211 amino acids and some bear no sequence similarity to others. PCR analysis and transient expression in HeLa cells show that the major bn2 mRNA isoforms are stable and are translated into equally stable proteins, even when the mRNA bears an early translational stop.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16942855"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16942855"],"type":"summary","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":"Overall, the combination of alternative splicing, post-translational modifications, protein folding dynamics, gene duplication, environmental factors, and protein-protein interactions contributes to the greater variation observed in proteins compared to genes.

{"body":"Mutation in pre-mRNA sequence","snippets":[{"text":"Ninety-four percent of human genes are discontinuous, such that segments expressed as mRNA are contained within exons and separated by intervening segments, called introns. Following transcription, genes are expressed as precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs), which are spliced co-transcriptionally, and the flanking exons are joined together to form a continuous mRNA. One advantage of this architecture is that it allows alternative splicing by differential use of exons to generate multiple mRNAs from individual genes. Regulatory elements located within introns and exons guide the splicing complex, the spliceosome, and auxiliary RNA binding proteins to the correct sites for intron removal and exon joining. Misregulation of splicing and alternative splicing can result from mutations in cis-regulatory elements within the affected gene or from mutations that affect the activities of trans-acting factors that are components of the splicing machinery. Mutations that affect splicing can cause disease directly or contribute to the susceptibility or severity of disease. An understanding of the role of splicing in disease expands potential opportunities for therapeutic intervention by either directly addressing the cause or by providing novel approaches to circumvent disease processes.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19918805"},{"text":"We present an intuitive strategy for predicting the effect of sequence variation on splicing. In contrast to transcriptional elements, splicing elements appear to be strongly position dependent. We demonstrated that exonic binding of the normally intronic splicing factor, U2AF65, inhibits splicing. Reasoning that the positional distribution of a splicing element is a signature of its function, we developed a method for organizing all possible sequence motifs into clusters based on the genomic profile of their positional distribution around splice sites. Binding sites for serine\/arginine rich (SR) proteins tended to be exonic whereas heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) recognition elements were mostly intronic. In addition to the known elements, novel motifs were returned and validated. This method was also predictive of splicing mutations. A mutation in a motif creates a new motif that sometimes has a similar distribution shape to the original motif and sometimes has a different distribution. We created an intraallelic distance measure to capture this property and found that mutations that created large intraallelic distances disrupted splicing in vivo whereas mutations with small distances did not alter splicing. Analyzing the dataset of human disease alleles revealed known splicing mutants to have high intraallelic distances and suggested that 22% of disease alleles that were originally classified as missense mutations may also affect splicing. This category together with mutations in the canonical splicing signals suggest that approximately one third of all disease-causing mutations alter pre-mRNA splicing.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21685335"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19918805","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21685335"],"type":"summary","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":"Overall, mutations in pre-mRNA sequences can have significant effects on gene expression, mRNA processing, and protein function, contributing to genetic diversity and disease pathology in organisms.

Ions passing through transducer channels depolarize a spike-initiating zone on the cell. These currents may also activate other conductances in the cell, so that the total generator current may have many components. In many mechanoreceptors, action potential initiation results in activation of an electrogenic Na+ pump at the spike-initiation zone, which modifies the threshold for subsequent action potentials. Action potentials initiated in the many branches of a single sensory axon interact at the branching point of the axon. The rules governing this interaction are complex.

Multiple phylogenetic analyses based on six genes revealed that they formed a deep branch within the alpha-proteobacteria, not affiliated with any of the alpha-proteobacterial orders.

The origin of the mitochondrion from an alpha-proteobacterium endosymbiont is strongly supported by molecular phylogenies. Accumulating data suggest that the endosymbiont's host was also a prokaryote.

We quantitatively investigated the effects of primer-template mismatches within the 3'-end primer region on real-time PCR using the 5'-nuclease assay. Our results show that single mismatches instigate a broad variety of effects, ranging from minor (<1.5 cycle threshold, eg, A-C, C-A, T-G, G-T) to severe impact (>7.0 cycle threshold, eg, A-A, G-A, A-G, C-C) on PCR amplification. A clear relationship between specific mismatch types, position, and impact was found, which remained consistent for DNA versus RNA amplifications and Taq\/Moloney murine leukemia virus versus rTth based amplifications. The overall size of the impact among the various master mixes used differed substantially (up to sevenfold), and for certain master mixes a reverse or forward primer-specific impact was observed, emphasizing the importance of the experimental conditions used. Taken together these data suggest that mismatch impact follows a consistent pattern and enabled us to formulate several guidelines for predicting primer-template mismatch behavior when using specific 5-nuclease assay master mixes.

Much has been learned about why fluoride is so effective and how this knowledge can be used to optimise programmes for caries prevention. Fluoride works through enhancing the remineralisation of early stages of caries and by inhibiting demineralisation, which would lead to dental caries. Remineralisation involves the deposition of calcium phosphates from saliva to rebuild partly dissolved enamel crystallites. When fluoride is incorporated the dissolution of these reinforced crystallites will be reduced during a subsequent sugar-induced and bacteria-mediated acid attack. Fluoride works primarily when it is present in the oral cavity. Based on our understanding of the fluoride mode of action the following advice can be given from clinicians to their patients: The fluoride concentration in oral products is related to efficacy but the concentration does not necessarily need to be high to be efficacious. Fluoride availability throughout the day is important; this can be achieved when fluoride products are used as part of the daily hygiene routine (F-brushing or rinsing). Alternatively, when fluoride is provided in the drinking water or through professionally applied F-varnishes or gels, the patient will benefit without requiring daily compliance to its use.

The mechanisms by which alcohol consumption exerts its carcinogenic effect have not been defined fully, although plausible events include: a genotoxic effect of acetaldehyde, the main metabolite of ethanol; increased oestrogen concentration, which is important for breast carcinogenesis; a role as solvent for tobacco carcinogens; production of reactive oxygen species and nitrogen species; and changes in folate metabolism.

Ethanol-induced cellular responses were analysed by a combination of the following assays: number of cells, amounts of DNA and protein, MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay and cell cycle. Ethanol dose-dependently suppressed these cellular functions, except that 12.5 mM exposures for both 6 and 26 h increased the amount of protein in spite of almost no change in other cellular functions, compared to the control. The most marked dose-dependency was observed in a reduction of formazan product in an MTT assay after both 6 and 26 h exposures to ethanol, being independent of the number of cells and probably reflecting dose-dependent depression of mitochondrial respiration. A G2 + M block in the cell cycle, an inhibition of cell division, was induced after short-term exposures (3 and 6 h) to 100 and 200 mM ethanol, but the block was released before 24 h had passed.

Here we describe a combined pulse-labeling, spatial proteomics and data analysis strategy to characterize the expression, localization, synthesis, degradation, and turnover rates of endogenously expressed, untagged human proteins in different subcellular compartments. Using quantitative mass spectrometry and stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture, a total of 80,098 peptides from 8,041 HeLa proteins were quantified, and their spatial distribution between the cytoplasm, nucleus and nucleolus determined and visualized using specialized software tools developed in PepTracker.

Expression levels of endogenous HeLa proteins varied by up to seven orders of magnitude. The average turnover rate for HeLa proteins was ~20 h. Turnover rate did not correlate with either molecular weight or net charge, but did correlate with abundance, with highly abundant proteins showing longer than average half-lives. Fast turnover proteins had overall a higher frequency of PEST motifs than slow turnover proteins but no general correlation was observed between amino or carboxyl terminal amino acid identities and turnover rates.

We hypothesize that RAGE-ligand interaction is a propagation factor in a range of chronic disorders, based on the enhanced accumulation of the ligands in diseased tissues. For example, increased levels of AGEs in diabetes and renal insufficiency, amyloid fibrils in Alzheimer's disease brain, amphoterin in tumors and S100\/calgranulins at sites of inflammation have been identified.

Furthermore, dream content is consistently and powerfully modulated by certain types of waking experiences. On the basis of this evidence, I put forward the hypothesis that the biological function of dreaming is to simulate threatening events, and to rehearse threat perception and threat avoidance. To evaluate this hypothesis, we need to consider the original evolutionary context of dreaming and the possible traces it has left in the dream content of the present human population. In the ancestral environment human life was short and full of threats. Any behavioral advantage in dealing with highly dangerous events would have increased the probability of reproductive success. A dream-production mechanism that tends to select threatening waking events and simulate them over and over again in various combinations would have been valuable for the development and maintenance of threat-avoidance skills. Empirical evidence from normative dream content, children's dreams, recurrent dreams, nightmares, post traumatic dreams, and the dreams of hunter-gatherers indicates that our dream-production mechanisms are in fact specialized in the simulation of threatening events, and thus provides support to the threat simulation hypothesis of the function of dreaming.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11515147"},{"text":"A process is proposed that helps a person adapt to a social environment.

One approach is to modify nongenetic risk factors, for instance by lowering elevated plasma homocysteine using B vitamins. In an initial, randomized controlled study on elderly subjects with increased dementia risk (mild cognitive impairment according to 2004 Petersen criteria), we showed that high-dose B-vitamin treatment (folic acid 0.8 mg, vitamin B6 20 mg, vitamin B12 0.5 mg) slowed shrinkage of the whole brain volume over 2 y. Here, we go further by demonstrating that B-vitamin treatment reduces, by as much as seven fold, the cerebral atrophy in those gray matter (GM) regions specifically vulnerable to the AD process, including the medial temporal lobe. In the placebo group, higher homocysteine levels at baseline are associated with faster GM atrophy, but this deleterious effect is largely prevented by B-vitamin treatment. We additionally show that the beneficial effect of B vitamins is confined to participants with high homocysteine (above the median, 11 \u00b5mol\/L) and that, in these participants, a causal Bayesian network analysis indicates the following chain of events: B vitamins lower homocysteine, which directly leads to a decrease in GM atrophy, thereby slowing cognitive decline. Our results show that B-vitamin supplementation can slow the atrophy of specific brain regions that are a key component of the AD process and that are associated with cognitive decline. Further B-vitamin supplementation trials focusing on elderly subjets with high homocysteine levels are warranted to see if progression to dementia can be prevented.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23690582"},{"text":"Antioxidants are widely used to protect cells from damage induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS).

Inactivation of p53 increases tumor growth to a similar degree as antioxidants and abolishes the antioxidant effect. Thus, antioxidants accelerate tumor growth by disrupting the ROS-p53 axis.

In the last several years there have been a number of studies attempting to identify mechanisms that stop thrombus growth. This paper identifies a novel mechanism related to formation of a fibrin cap. In particular, protein transport through a fibrin network, an important component of a thrombus, was studied by integrating experiments with model simulations. The network permeability and the protein diffusivity were shown to be important factors determining the transport of proteins through the fibrin network. Our previous in vivo studies in mice have shown that stabilized non-occluding thrombi are covered by a fibrin network ('fibrin cap'). Model simulations, calibrated using experiments in microfluidic devices and accounting for the permeable structure of the fibrin cap, demonstrated that thrombin generated inside the thrombus was washed downstream through the fibrin network, thus limiting exposure of platelets on the thrombus surface to thrombin. Moreover, by restricting the approach of resting platelets in the flowing blood to the thrombus core, the fibrin cap impaired platelets from reaching regions of high thrombin concentration necessary for platelet activation and limited thrombus growth. The formation of a fibrin cap prevents small thrombi that frequently develop in the absence of major injury in the 60000 km of vessels in the body from developing into life threatening events.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23785270"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23785270"],"type":"factoid","exact_answer":"A thrombus is a blood clot that forms within a blood vessel or the heart.

Using a kinetic approach, an equation was derived which allowed determination of the average half-lives of polyadenylated RNA: in each medium the cultures were labeled from the moment of the inoculation with [32P]orthophosphate and were then given a 10-min pulse with [5-3H]uridine when they were in the exponential phase. It was found that the determined half-lives of polyadenylated RNA vary, depending on the growth medium, between 30 and 60 min, but with no direct correlation with the growth rate. Moreover, the rate of synthesis of polyadenylated RNA relative to that of stable RNA decreased with the growth rate. On the basis of previous data on the rates of synthesis of stable RNA, it was possible to make an evaluation of the absolute rate of synthesis of polyadenylated RNA. Whereas the rate of synthesis of stable ribosomal RNA increases as a function of the square of the number of duplications per hour, the increase in the rate of synthesis of polyadenylated RNA with the growth rate is much less consistent.

One of the outstanding problems is the rate of adsorption, which in some cases appears to exceed the theoretical limit imposed by the law of random diffusion. We revisit this problem by conducting experiments along with new theoretical analyses. Our measurements show that upon incubating lambda-phage with bacteria Ymel, the population of unbound phage in a salt buffer decreases with time and in general obeys a double-exponential function characterized by a fast (tau(1)) and a slow (tau(2)) decay time. We found that both the fast and the slow processes are specific to interactions between lambda-phage and its receptor LamB. Such specificity motivates a kinetic model that describes the interaction between the phage and the receptor as an on-and-off process followed by an irreversible binding. The latter may be a signature of the initiation of DNA translocation. The kinetic model successfully predicts the double exponential behavior seen in the experiment and allows the corresponding rate constants to be extracted from single measurements.

To identify factors affecting long-distance activation, we screened for mutants allowing activation of a reporter when the UAS-TATA distance is 799 bp. These screens identified four loci, SIN4, SPT2, SPT10, and HTA1-HTB1, with sin4 mutations being the strongest.

In this article, we address the question of how plasmids manage to persist over evolutionary time. Empirical studies suggest that plasmids are not infectiously transmitted at a rate high enough to be maintained as genetic parasites. In part i, we present a general mathematical proof that if this is the case, then plasmids will not be able to persist indefinitely solely by carrying genes that are beneficial or sometimes beneficial to their host bacteria. Instead, such genes should, in the long run, be incorporated into the bacterial chromosome. If the mobility of host-adaptive genes imposes a cost, that mobility will eventually be lost. In part ii, we illustrate a pair of mechanisms by which plasmids can be maintained indefinitely even when their rates of transmission are too low for them to be genetic parasites. First, plasmids may persist because they can transfer locally adapted genes to newly arriving strains bearing evolutionary innovations, and thereby preserve the local adaptations in the face of background selective sweeps. Second, plasmids may persist because of their ability to shuttle intermittently favored genes back and forth between various (noncompeting) bacterial strains, ecotypes, or even species.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10924453"},{"text":"The conditions under which plasmids are predicted to persist remain controversial.

This complexity could be attributed to the fact that melatonin receptors belong to two distinct classes of proteins, that is, the G-protein coupled receptor superfamily (MT(1), MT(2)) and the quinone reductase enzyme family (MT(3)) which makes them unique at the molecular level. Also, within the G-protein coupled receptor family of proteins, the MT(1) and MT(2) receptors can couple to multiple and distinct signal transduction cascades whose activation can lead to unique cellular responses. Also, throughout the 24-hour cycle, the receptors' sensitivity to specific cues fluctuates and this sensitivity can be modulated in a homologous fashion, that is, by melatonin itself, and in a heterologous manner, that is, by other cues including the photoperiod or estrogen. This sensitivity of response may reflect changes in melatonin receptor density that also occurs throughout the 24-hour light\/dark cycle but out of phase with circulating melatonin levels.

In most vertebrates, including humans, melatonin is synthesized primarily in the pineal gland and is regulated by the environmental light\/dark cycle via the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Pinealocytes function as 'neuroendocrine transducers' to secrete melatonin during the dark phase of the light\/dark cycle and, consequently, melatonin is often called the 'hormone of darkness'. Melatonin is principally secreted at night and is centrally involved in sleep regulation, as well as in a number of other cyclical bodily activities. Melatonin is exclusively involved in signaling the 'time of day' and 'time of year' (hence considered to help both clock and calendar functions) to all tissues and is thus considered to be the body's chronological pacemaker or 'Zeitgeber'. Synthesis of melatonin also occurs in other areas of the body, including the retina, the gastrointestinal tract, skin, bone marrow and in lymphocytes, from which it may influence other physiological functions through paracrine signaling. Melatonin has also been extracted from the seeds and leaves of a number of plants and its concentration in some of this material is several orders of magnitude higher than its night-time plasma value in humans. Melatonin participates in diverse physiological functions. In addition to its timekeeping functions, melatonin is an effective antioxidant which scavenges free radicals and up-regulates several antioxidant enzymes. It also has a strong antiapoptotic signaling function, an effect which it exerts even during ischemia. Melatonin's cytoprotective properties have practical implications in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Melatonin also has immune-enhancing and oncostatic properties. Its 'chronobiotic' properties have been shown to have value in treating various circadian rhythm sleep disorders, such as jet lag or shift-work sleep disorder. Melatonin acting as an 'internal sleep facilitator' promotes sleep, and melatonin's sleep-facilitating properties have been found to be useful for treating insomnia symptoms in elderly and depressive patients. A recently introduced melatonin analog, agomelatine, is also efficient for the treatment of major depressive disorder and bipolar affective disorder. Melatonin's role as a 'photoperiodic molecule' in seasonal reproduction has been established in photoperiodic species, although its regulatory influence in humans remains under investigation.

Refinements of the DA hypothesis have lead to the emergence of new pharmacological targets for antipsychotic drug development. It was shown that effective antipsychotic drugs with a low liability for inducing extra-pyramidal side-effects have affinities for a range of neurotransmitter receptors in addition to DA receptors, suggesting that a combination of neurotransmitter receptor affinities may be favorable for treatment outcome.This review focuses on the interaction between DA and 5-HT, as most antipsychotics display affinity for 5-HT receptors. We will discuss DA\/5-HT interactions at the level of receptors and G protein-coupled potassium channels and consequences for induction of depolarization blockade with specific attention to DA neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the substantia nigra zona compacta (SN), neurons implicated in treatment efficacy and the side-effects of schizophrenia, respectively. Moreover, it has been reported that electrophysiological interactions between DA and 5-HT show subtle, but important, differences between the SN and the VTA which could explain (in part) the effectiveness and lower propensity to induce side-effects of the newer atypical antipsychotic drugs. In that respect the functional implications of DA\/5-HT interactions for schizophrenia will be discussed.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18615139"},{"text":"Dopamine is an inhibitory neurotransmitter involved in the pathology of schizophrenia.

First recognized as an endotoxin-induced serum factor that caused necrosis of tumors and cachexia, it is now recognized that TNF participates in the pathophysiology of a group of inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. The normal heart does not express TNF; however, the failing heart produces robust quantities. Furthermore, there is a direct relationship between the level of TNF expression and the severity of disease. In addition, both in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrate that TNF effects cellular and biochemical changes that mirror those seen in patients with congestive heart failure. Furthermore, in animal models, the development of the heart failure phenotype can be abrogated at least in part by anticytokine therapy. Based on information from experimental studies, investigators are now evaluating the clinical efficacy of novel anticytokine and anti-TNF strategies in patients with heart failure; one such strategy is the use of a recombinantly produced chimeric TNF alpha soluble receptor. Thus, in view of the emerging importance of proinflammatory cytokines in the pathogenesis of heart disease, we review the biology of TNF, its role in inflammatory diseases, the effects of TNF on the physiology of the heart and the development of clinical strategies that target the cytokine pathways.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10716453"},{"text":"Cardiac arrhythmias are one of the main causes of death worldwide. Several studies have shown that inflammation plays a key role in different cardiac diseases and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) seem to be involved in cardiac complications. In the present study, we investigated whether the activation of TLR4 induces cardiac electrical remodeling and arrhythmias, and the signaling pathway involved in these effects. Membrane potential was recorded in Wistar rat ventricle. Ca(2+) transients, as well as the L-type Ca(2+) current (ICaL) and the transient outward K(+) current (Ito), were recorded in isolated myocytes after 24 h exposure to the TLR4 agonist, lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 \u03bcg\/ml). TLR4 stimulation in vitro promoted a cardiac electrical remodeling that leads to action potential prolongation associated with arrhythmic events, such as delayed afterdepolarization and triggered activity. After 24 h LPS incubation, Ito amplitude, as well as Kv4.3 and KChIP2 mRNA levels were reduced. The Ito decrease by LPS was prevented by inhibition of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), but not by inhibition of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) or nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB). Extrasystolic activity was present in 25% of the cells, but apart from that, Ca(2+) transients and ICaL were not affected by LPS; however, Na(+)\/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) activity was apparently increased. We conclude that TLR4 activation decreased Ito, which increased AP duration via a MyD88-independent, IRF3-dependent pathway. The longer action potential, associated with enhanced Ca(2+) efflux via NCX, could explain the presence of arrhythmias in the LPS group.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25169970"},{"text":"Overexpression of TNF-alpha in the heart leads to severe myocarditis and cardiomegaly.

SEC retention data were obtained using a Sephacryl S-1000 SF resin packed column and an Agilent HPLC system over a range of flow rates using buffers of different ionic strength and composition. The plasmid partition coefficients, K(P), were evaluated from the first statistical moment of the chromatographic peak. The partition coefficient decreased with increasing plasmid size as expected; K(P) varied from 0.299 to 0.045 for supercoiled plasmids of 3.0 to 17.0kbp. The partition coefficient also increased with increasing ionic strength due to the compaction of the DNA associated with the shielding of the intramolecular electrostatic interactions. For any plasmid size, the supercoiled isoform had the highest K(P) followed by the open-circular and then the linear isoform, consistent with independent estimates of the plasmid radius of gyration as determined by static light scattering.

The length of the Fe(III)-O bond is consistent with an alkoxide and not an alcohol coordinating group. The iron porphyrin is five coordinate and monomeric. Changes in the electronic spectrum of Fe(III)PPIX upon addition of halofantrine base in acetonitrile solution are almost identical to those observed upon addition of quinidine free base in the same solvent.

Molecular mechanics modeling of Fe(III)PPIX complexes of quinidine, quinine, 9-epiquinine and 9-epiquinidine based on this homology suggests that the antimalarially active quinidine and quinine can readily adopt conformations that permit formation of an intramolecular salt bridge between the protonated quinuclidine tertiary amino group and unprotonated heme propionate group, while the inactive epimers 9-epiquinidine and 9-epiquinine have to adopt high energy conformations in order to accommodate such salt bridge formation.

Interpretations of this interaction have taken place in a scientific environment whose most secure element is the immunochemistry of allergic reactions resulting in a substantial body of literature that has sought a biological role for allergic reactivity in protective immunity directed against helminth parasites. While the association between helminth infections and elevated levels of IgE, mast cells and eosinophils is well established, a functional role for allergic reactions in protection against helminths has eluded experimental proof. Instead of this hypothesis, it is proposed that allergic reactivity is rarely present in helminth-infected individuals because allergic reactions do not function to regulate helminth infections. Data from many sources are used to establish that the 'normal' state of all mammals is to be infected with helminth parasites from shortly after birth until well into adulthood. Only in the last 100 years or so have people living in areas of high development with sophisticated water and sewage systems been able to escape helminth infection. Allergies are as conspicuously present in these human populations as they are absent in populations that are still regularly exposed to helminths. Furthermore, in populations with endemic helminthoses there is little overt expression of allergic pathology that could be connected to the acquisition or elimination of helminth parasites. Based on these observations, it is suggested that endemic helminthoses activate the Th2 system, particularly at mucosal surfaces, to provide a different level of immunological homeostasis than currently occurs in developed societies. Under these conditions, mast cells, eosinophils and IgE rarely participate in reactions that we would recognize as 'allergic', although their participation in the control of helminth infections is still envisaged. Allergic reactions are considered to be a purely pathologic consequence of the disruption of this homeostatic mechanism and are not protective at all for the individual expressing them. This interpretation is derived from the immunobiology of the host-parasite interaction rather than the biology of allergies and should lead to new concepts regarding both allergic disease and the role of helminth infections in human and animal populations.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8872184"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12672069","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22193986","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8872184"],"type":"summary","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":"Overall, while IgE antibodies are best known for their role in allergic responses, they also serve important beneficial functions in the immune system, including defense against parasites, facilitation of antigen presentation, regulation of immune responses, and promotion of wound healing and tissue repair."}

However, for actively replicating viruses--particularly small DNA viruses--the methylation status of CpG motifs is rarely known and the effects on the viral life cycle are obscure.

The question as to why the red blood cell should have this particular profile remains unresolved. It has been suggested that this shape maximises the surface area to volume ratio and thus expedites diffusion. This hypothesis, however does not stand up to examination. Maximal diffusion occurs in the small vessels. In order to pass through the microvasculature the erythrocyte becomes distorted and deviates from the biconcave disc shape [Branemark PI, Lindstrom J. The shape of circulating blood corpuscles. Biorheology 1963;1:139; Guest MM, Bond TP, Cooper RG, Derrick JR. Red blood cells: change in capillaries. Science 1963;142:1319-21]. Here, it is suggested the haemodynamic factors have dictated the peculiar shape of the discocyte. The deleterious nature of turbulent flow on the cardiovascular system suggests that the biconcave disc form has evolved out of a necessity to maximise laminar flow, minimise platelet scatter which in turn suppress atherogenic activity in the large vessels [Yoshizumi M, Abe J, Tsuchiya K, Berk BC, Tamaki T. Stress and vascular responses: athero-protective effect of laminar fluid shear stress in endothelial cells: possible and mitogen-activated protein kinases. J Pharmacol Sci 2003;9:172-6]. The biconcave profile of the discocyte means that much of the mass is distributed in the periphery. This increases the moment of inertia of the cell and subsequently renders the erythrocyte less prone to rotation during flow in the large vessels. Here it is suggest that this reduction in rotation promotes laminar flow and discourages platelet scattering by minimising the \"Eddy currents\" and it thus anti-atherogenic. A number of pathological mutations result in the red blood cell adopting a spherical shape as opposed to the biconcave disc profile. The sphere has a smaller moment of inertia when compared to the discocyte, as much of the mass is distributed round the centre. The spherocyte is hence much more prone to rotation during flow in the large vessels. There is evidence to suggest that asplenic individuals suffering from spherocytosis are at increased risk of atherogenic cerebrovascular and cardiovascular large-vessel disease, when compared with their asplenic haematological normal counterparts [Schilling RF.

The finite-element method is used to solve the governing partial differential equations. It is found that the shape of RBCs, characterized by the shape parameter theta adapted from Zarda et al., affects such important O2 transport characteristics as capillary wall O2 flux and hemoglobin (Hb) saturation. At an RBC residence time (time for an RBC to travel from the capillary inlet to a given point) of 0.22 s, a change in the shape parameter theta from 0 (undeformed cell) to 26 (parachute-shaped cell) decreases the spatially averaged O2 flux by 26%. The dependence of O2 flux on RBC shape diminishes as the RBC residence time increases. The difference in Hb saturation at the RBC residence time of 0.22 s can be as large as 10% for different values of theta. The mass transfer Nusselt number, which is inversely proportional to transport resistance, decreases with increases in theta. The fractional transport resistance in the plasma region accounts for approximately 65-80% of the total intracapillary resistance.

{"body":"Why does rabies cause hydrophobia?","snippets":[{"text":"Rabies virus (RABV) is a neurotropic virus that depends on long distance axonal transport in order to reach the central nervous system (CNS). The strategy RABV uses to hijack the cellular transport machinery is still not clear. It is thought that RABV interacts with membrane receptors in order to internalize and exploit the endosomal trafficking pathway, yet this has never been demonstrated directly. The p75 Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) receptor (p75NTR) binds RABV Glycoprotein (RABV-G) with high affinity. However, as p75NTR is not essential for RABV infection, the specific role of this interaction remains in question. Here we used live cell imaging to track RABV entry at nerve terminals and studied its retrograde transport along the axon with and without the p75NTR receptor. First, we found that NGF, an endogenous p75NTR ligand, and RABV, are localized in corresponding domains along nerve tips. RABV and NGF were internalized at similar time frames, suggesting comparable entry machineries. Next, we demonstrated that RABV could internalize together with p75NTR. Characterizing RABV retrograde movement along the axon, we showed the virus is transported in acidic compartments, mostly with p75NTR. Interestingly, RABV is transported faster than NGF, suggesting that RABV not only hijacks the transport machinery but can also manipulate it. Co-transport of RABV and NGF identified two modes of transport, slow and fast, that may represent a differential control of the trafficking machinery by RABV. Finally, we determined that p75NTR-dependent transport of RABV is faster and more directed than p75NTR-independent RABV transport. This fast route to the neuronal cell body is characterized by both an increase in instantaneous velocities and fewer, shorter stops en route. Hence, RABV may employ p75NTR-dependent transport as a fast mechanism to facilitate movement to the CNS.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25165859"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25165859"],"type":"summary","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":"In summary, hydrophobia in rabies is a consequence of neurological damage and dysfunction caused by the virus, leading to dysphagia, aerophobia, and aversive responses to water stimuli.

The unpredictable onset, ease of transmission, rapid progression of disease, high mortality and lack of effective vaccine or therapy have created a high level of public concern about EboV. Here we report the identification of a novel benzylpiperazine adamantane diamide-derived compound that inhibits EboV infection. Using mutant cell lines and informative derivatives of the lead compound, we show that the target of the inhibitor is the endosomal membrane protein Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1). We find that NPC1 is essential for infection, that it binds to the virus glycoprotein (GP), and that antiviral compounds interfere with GP binding to NPC1. Combined with the results of previous studies of GP structure and function, our findings support a model of EboV infection in which cleavage of the GP1 subunit by endosomal cathepsin proteases removes heavily glycosylated domains to expose the amino-terminal domain, which is a ligand for NPC1 and regulates membrane fusion by the GP2 subunit.

Additional host factors in the endosomal compartment are probably required for viral membrane fusion; however, despite considerable efforts, these critical host factors have defied molecular identification. Here we describe a genome-wide haploid genetic screen in human cells to identify host factors required for Ebola virus entry. Our screen uncovered 67 mutations disrupting all six members of the homotypic fusion and vacuole protein-sorting (HOPS) multisubunit tethering complex, which is involved in the fusion of endosomes to lysosomes, and 39 independent mutations that disrupt the endo\/lysosomal cholesterol transporter protein Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1). Cells defective for the HOPS complex or NPC1 function, including primary fibroblasts derived from human Niemann-Pick type C1 disease patients, are resistant to infection by Ebola virus and Marburg virus, but remain fully susceptible to a suite of unrelated viruses.

Human NPC1 fulfills a cardinal property of viral receptors: it confers susceptibility to filovirus infection when expressed in non-permissive reptilian cells. The second luminal domain of NPC1 binds directly and specifically to the viral glycoprotein, GP, and a synthetic single-pass membrane protein containing this domain has viral receptor activity. Purified NPC1 binds only to a cleaved form of GP that is generated within cells during entry, and only viruses containing cleaved GP can utilize a receptor retargeted to the cell surface.

Recent studies indicate that cellular entry of this family of viruses requires a series of cellular protein interactions and molecular mechanisms, some of which are unique to filoviruses and others are commonly used by all viral glycoproteins. Details of this entry pathway are highlighted here. Virus entry into cells is initiated by the interaction of the viral glycoprotein(1) subunit (GP(1)) with both adherence factors and one or more receptors on the surface of host cells. On epithelial cells, we recently demonstrated that TIM-1 serves as a receptor for this family of viruses, but the cell surface receptors in other cell types remain unidentified. Upon receptor binding, the virus is internalized into endosomes primarily via macropinocytosis, but perhaps by other mechanisms as well. Within the acidified endosome, the heavily glycosylated GP(1) is cleaved to a smaller form by the low pH-dependent cellular proteases Cathepsin L and B, exposing residues in the receptor binding site (RBS). Details of the molecular events following cathepsin-dependent trimming of GP(1) are currently incomplete; however, the processed GP(1) specifically interacts with endosomal\/lysosomal membranes that contain the Niemann Pick C1 (NPC1) protein and expression of NPC1 is required for productive infection, suggesting that GP\/NPC1 interactions may be an important late step in the entry process. Additional events such as further GP(1) processing and\/or reducing events may also be required to generate a fusion-ready form of the glycoprotein. Once this has been achieved, sequences in the filovirus GP(2) subunit mediate viral\/cellular membrane fusion via mechanisms similar to those previously described for other enveloped viruses.

Tyrosinase (TYR) is absolutely required for melanogenesis, but other melanosomal proteins, such as TYRP1, DCT, and gp100, also play important roles in regulating mammalian pigmentation. However, pigmentation does not always correlate with the expression of TYR mRNA\/protein, and thus its function is also regulated at the post-translational level. Thus, TYR does not necessarily exist in a catalytically active state, and its post-translational activation could be an important control point for regulating melanin synthesis. In this study, we used a multidisciplinary approach to examine the processing and sorting of TYR through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, coated vesicles, endosomes and early melanosomes because those organelles hold the key to understanding the trafficking of TYR to melanosomes and thus the regulation of melanogenesis. In pigmented cells, TYR is trafficked through those organelles rapidly, but in amelanotic cells, TYR is retained within the ER and is eventually degraded by proteasomes. We now show that TYR can be released from the ER in the presence of protonophore or proton pump inhibitors which increase the pH of intracellular organelles, after which TYR is transported correctly to the Golgi, and then to melanosomes via the endosomal sorting system. The expression of TYRP1, which facilitates TYR processing in the ER, is down-regulated in the amelanotic cells; this is analogous to a hypopigmentary disease known as oculocutaneous albinism type 3 and further impairs melanin production.

Because sodium\/hydrogen (Na(+)\/H(+)) exchangers (NHEs) are known to regulate intracellular pH, melanocytes were treated with NHE inhibitors to determine what effect this inhibition might have on tyrosinase activity. Treatment of Black melanocytes with ethyl-isopropyl amiloride (EIPA) caused a rapid dose-dependent inhibition of tyrosinase activity. This inhibition was not due to either direct enzyme inhibition or to a decrease in tyrosinase abundance.

Both types of pigment derive from the common precursor dopaquinone (ortho-quinone of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) which is formed via the oxidation of l-tyrosine by the melanogenic enzyme tyrosinase. Dopaquinone is a highly reactive ortho-quinone that plays pivotal roles in the chemical control of melanogenesis. In the absence of sulfhydryl compounds, dopaquinone undergoes intramolecular cyclization to form cyclodopa, which is then rapidly oxidized by a redox reaction with dopaquinone to give dopachrome (and dopa). Dopachrome then gradually and spontaneously rearranges to form 5,6-dihydroxyindole and to a lesser extent 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid, the ratio of which is determined by a distinct melanogenic enzyme termed dopachrome tautomerase (tyrosinase-related protein-2). Oxidation and subsequent polymerization of these dihydroxyindoles leads to the production of eumelanin. However, when cysteine is present, this process gives rise preferentially to the production of cysteinyldopa isomers. Cysteinyldopas are subsequently oxidized through redox reaction with dopaquinone to form cysteinyldopaquinones that eventually lead to the production of pheomelanin. Pulse radiolysis studies of early stages of melanogenesis (involving dopaquinone and cysteine) indicate that mixed melanogenesis proceeds in three distinct stages-the initial production of cysteinyldopas, followed by their oxidation to produce pheomelanin, followed finally by the production of eumelanin.

For normal frog sciatic nerves the magnitude of the propagation potential was 17% of the peak of the extracellular action potential; TEA increased it to 32%. For normal earthworm median or lateral giant fibers it was 30%. A ripple pattern on the propagation potential was attributed to variation in resistance along the length of the worm. Cooling increased the duration of the propagation potential and attenuated the higher frequency components of the ripple pattern. Differential records from two widely spaced intracellular microelectrodes in the same axon differed from the propagation potential. The amplitude of the plateau relative to the peak was smaller, it decreased as the action potential propagated from one electrode site to the other, and the potential did not return to zero as rapidly as for extracellular records. When propagation was blocked by heat, the propagation potential slowly decayed. There was no ripple pattern during the decay. In a volume conductor, electrodes contacting the worm did not show the typical propagation potential, but electrodes located a few centimeters away from the worm did.

The transfer of lipids is also responsible for the triggering of membrane associated events such as blood coagulation, the recognition and elimination of apoptotic or aged cells, and the regulation of phosphatidylserine dependent enzymes. Exposure of new lipid-head groups on a membrane leaflet by rapid flip-flop can serve as a specific signal and, upon recognition, can be the cause of physiological modifications. Membrane bending is one of the mechanisms by which such activities can be triggered.

Mitochondria are evolutionary endosymbionts that were derived from bacteria and so might bear bacterial molecular motifs.

Cochlear damage can produce permanent hearing loss, and damage to the vestibular apparatus results in dizziness, ataxia, and\/or nystagmus. Aminoglycosides appear to generate free radicals within the inner ear, with subsequent permanent damage to sensory cells and neurons, resulting in permanent hearing loss. Two mutations in the mitochondrial 12S ribosomal RNA gene have been previously reported to predispose carriers to aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity. As aminoglycosides are indispensable agents both in the treatment of infections and Meniere's disease, a great effort has been made to develop strategies to prevent aminoglycoside ototoxicity. Anti-free radical agents, such as salicylate, have been shown to attenuate the ototoxic effects of aminoglycosides.

Exercise is characterised by a shift in blood flow away from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract towards the active muscle and the lungs. Changes in nervous activity, in circulating hormones, peptides and metabolic end products lead to changes in GI motility, blood flow, absorption and secretion. In exhausting endurance events, 30 to 50% of participants may suffer from 1 or more GI symptoms, which have often been interpreted as being a result of maldigestion, malabsorption, changes in small intestinal transit, and improper food and fluid intake. Results of field and laboratory studies show that pre-exercise ingestion of foods rich in dietary fibre, fat and protein, as well as strongly hypertonic drinks, may cause upper GI symptoms such as stomach ache, vomiting and reflux or heartburn. There is no evidence that the ingestion of nonhypertonic drinks during exercise induces GI distress and diarrhoea. In contrast, dehydration because of insufficient fluid replacement has been shown to increase the frequency of GI symptoms. Lower GI symptoms, such as intestinal cramps, diarrhoea--sometimes bloody--and urge to defecate seem to be more related to changes in gut motility and tone, as well as a secretion. These symptoms are to a large extent induced by the degree of decrease in GI blood flow and the secretion of secretory substances such as vasoactive intestinal peptide, secretin and peptide-histidine-methionine. Intensive exercise causes considerable reflux, delays small intestinal transit, reduces absorption and tends to increase colonic transit. The latter may reduce whole gut transit time. The gut is not an athletic organ in the sense that it adapts to increased exercise-induced physiological stress. However, adequate training leads to a less dramatic decrease of GI blood flow at submaximal exercise intensities and is important in the prevention of GI symptoms.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8460288"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18392240","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19560716","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8460288"],"type":"yesno","exact_answer":"yes","ideal_answer":"Yes, taking a walk after a meal can help aid digestion and improve overall gastrointestinal function.

Mycobacterial IdeR is an iron-dependent repressor that shows 80% identity in the functional domains with its corynebacterial homologue, DtxR (diphtheria toxin repressor). We have transformed Mycobacterium tuberculosis with a vector expressing an iron-independent, positive dominant, corynebacterial dtxR hyperrepressor, DtxR(E175K). Western blots of whole-cell lysates of M. tuberculosis expressing the dtxR(E175K) gene revealed the stable expression of the mutant protein in mycobacteria. BALB\/c mice were infected by tail vein injection with 2 x 10(5) organisms of wild type or M. tuberculosis transformed with the dtxR mutant. At 16 weeks, there was a 1.2 log reduction in bacterial survivors in both spleen (P = 0.0002) and lungs (P = 0.006) with M. tuberculosis DtxR(E175K). A phenotypic difference in colonial morphology between the two strains also was noted. A computerized search of the M. tuberculosis genome for the palindromic consensus sequence to which DtxR and IdeR bind revealed six putative \"iron boxes\" within 200 bp of an ORF. Using a gel-shift assay we showed that purified DtxR binds to the operator region of five of these boxes. Attenuation of M. tuberculosis can be achieved by the insertion of a plasmid containing a constitutively active, iron-insensitive repressor, DtxR(E175K), which is a homologue of IdeR.

We have identified novel combinations of excipients that greatly enhance the thermal stability of live-attenuated DEN-2 PDK-53-based flavivirus vaccine candidates. Liquid formulations comprising a sugar, albumin and a pluronic polymer minimized the loss of flavivirus infectious titer to less than 0.5 log(10)pfu after storage for at least 8h at 37\u00b0C, 7 days at room temperature or at least 11 weeks at 4\u00b0C. Additionally, these formulations prevented reduction of viral infectivity after two freeze-thaw cycles of virus. Formulated candidate vaccines were readily lyophilized and reconstituted with minimal loss of viral titers. In mice, the formulations were safe and did not hinder the ability of the vaccine virus to generate a potent, protective immune response. These formulations provided significantly greater liquid-phase stability than has been reported previously for other flavivirus vaccine formulations.

Anoxygenic photosynthesis may also be responsible for the filamentous mats found in the 3.4-Ga Buck Reef Chert in South Africa. Another early reductant was probably H2S. Eventually the supply of H2 in the atmosphere was likely to have been attenuated by the production of CH4 by methanogens, and the supply of H2S was likely to have been restricted to special environments near volcanos. Evaporites, possible stromatolites, and possible microfossils found in the 3.5-Ga Warrawoona Megasequence in Australia are attributed to sulfur-driven photosynthesis.

As expected, cold-acclimated workers recovered faster from freezing temperatures, but subsequent heat acclimation did not change the short recovery times observed after cold acclimation. Hence, either heat acclimation improves cold tolerance, possibly as a general response to stress, or at least it does not negate enhanced cold tolerance following cold acclimation. Colonies collected in spring showed similar cold tolerance levels to cold-acclimated colonies in the laboratory. Next, we compared the chill-coma recovery time of different worker castes and found that exterior workers recovered faster than interior workers. This difference may be related to their more frequent exposure to cold, higher activity level, or distinct physiology. Interior workers were also heavier and showed a higher gaster-to-head ratio and thorax ratio compared to exterior workers. An obvious difference between exterior and interior workers is activity level, but we found no link between activity and cold tolerance.

Melatonin (0.4 microg\/ml) or vehicle was administered in the drinking water of 10-month-old male Sprague Dawley rats (18\/treatment) for 12 weeks. Half (9\/treatment) were then killed, and the other half were submitted to cross-over treatment for an additional 12 weeks.

Food intake and total body fat were not changed by melatonin treatment. Melatonin-treated rats that were then crossed over to control treatment for a further 12 weeks gained BW, whereas control rats that were crossed to melatonin treatment lost BW, but food intake did not change in either group. Feed efficiency (grams of BW change per g cumulative food intake), a measure of metabolic function, was negative in melatonin-treated rats and positive in control rats before cross-over (P<0.001); this relationship was reversed after cross-over (P<0.001). Thus, melatonin treatment in middle age decreased BW, intraabdominal adiposity, plasma insulin, and plasma leptin, without altering food intake or total adiposity.

Several aspects of fluoride metabolism - including gastric absorption, distribution and renal excretion - are pH-dependent because the coefficient of permeability of lipid bilayer membranes to hydrogen fluoride (HF) is 1 million times higher than that of F(-). This means that fluoride readily crosses cell membranes as HF, in response to a pH gradient between adjacent body fluid compartments. After ingestion, plasma fluoride levels increase rapidly due to the rapid absorption from the stomach, an event that is pH-dependent and distinguishes fluoride from other halogens and most other substances. The majority of fluoride not absorbed from the stomach will be absorbed from the small intestine. In this case, absorption is not pH-dependent. Fluoride not absorbed will be excreted in feces. Peak plasma fluoride concentrations are reached within 20-60 min following ingestion. The levels start declining thereafter due to two main reasons: uptake in calcified tissues and excretion in urine. Plasma fluoride levels are not homeostatically regulated and vary according to the levels of intake, deposition in hard tissues and excretion of fluoride.

{"body":"Mechanism of antiperistalsis","snippets":[{"text":"Ingestion of toxin, traumatic events, adverse drug reactions, and motion can all result in nausea and emesis. In addition, cyclic vomiting syndrome is quite prevalent in the pediatric population. Coordination of the various autonomic changes associated with emesis occurs at the level of the medulla oblongata of the hindbrain. Chemosensitive receptors detect emetic agents in the blood and relay this information by means of neurons in the area postrema to the adjacent nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). Abdominal vagal afferents that detect intestinal luminal contents and gastric tone also terminate in the NTS (gelatinosus, commissural, and medial subnuclei). The NTS is viscerotopically organized into subnuclei that subserve diverse functions related to swallowing (subnucleus centralis), gastric sensation (subnucleus gelatinosus), laryngeal and pharyngeal sensation (intermediate and interstitial NTS), baroreceptor function (medial NTS), and respiration (ventrolateral NTS). Neurons from the NTS project to a central pattern generator (CPG), which coordinates the sequence of behaviors during emesis, as well as directly to diverse populations of neurons in the ventral medulla and hypothalamus. Thus, it is critical to realize that there is not an isolated \"vomiting center,\" but rather groups of loosely organized neurons throughout the medulla that may be activated in sequence by a CPG. The newer antiemetic agents appear to block receptors in the peripheral endings of vagal afferents to reduce \"perception\" of emetic stimuli and\/or act in the dorsal vagal complex. A primary site of action of 5-HT(3)-receptor antagonists is by means of the vagal afferents. Neurokinin-1 receptor (NK(1)R) antagonists are antiemetics, because they act at a site in the dorsal vagal complex. Part of their effectiveness may be the result of inhibition of the NK(1)R on vagal motor neurons to prevent fundic relaxation, which is a prodromal event essential for emesis. Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(9)-THC), the major psychoactive component of marijuana, can be therapeutically useful as an antiemetic. The site of action of Delta(9)-THC is on cannabinoid CB1 receptors in the dorsal vagal complex. However, it decreases fundic tone and antral motility. It is not easy to predict the potential antiemetic effects of drugs that alter motility. Although antiemetic drugs are available for management of acute chemotherapeutic-induced emesis, few treatments are effective for delayed emesis or cyclic vomiting syndrome.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11749934"},{"text":"In a cineradiographic analysis of the vomiting reflex in response to i.v. administration of an emetic drug (lanatoside C, 12 mg\/kg) in cats, it was shown that the vomiting act is preceded by cyclic periods of abnormal peristaltic activity of the small bowel and inhibition of gastric peristalsis. It was further observed that massive antiperistalsis of the upper small bowel with reflux into the stomach is a common occurrence in the period immediately preceding vomiting. The emetic act itself is composed of phases of esophageal dilation, gastric emptying, gastric reflux, and esophageal collapse in cyclic repetition. The response of the esophagus and the stomach during emesis is passive, with external pressures and forces apparently providing the expulsive forces, the gastric bolus being contained by contraction of the pylorus and probably an upper esophageal or pharyngeal barrier. Earlier studies were conducted in cats in which observations were made on changes in thoracic venous pressure, abdominal venous pressure, and arterial blood pressure associated with vomiting induced by Veratrum alkaloids. Retching was characterized by a growing series of brief negative intrathoracic pressure pulses mirrored by positive pressure pulses in the abdomen. Expulsion then occurred and was followed with a sudden reversal of intrathoracic pressure from negative to positive. Expulsion involved a more sustained abdominal contraction, but both retching and expulsion were brought about by the same set of muscles, according to their EMG profiles.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are the most important etiological factors of HCC, accounting for more than 70% of cases worldwide. The risk of HCC development is greatly increased in chronic viral carriers exposed to other recognized risk factors, including exposure to aflatoxin B1, alcoholic cirrhosis and diabetes. The importance of HBV genotypes and precore or core promoter mutants remains incompletely understood. The role of HBV in tumour formation appears to be complex and may involve both direct and indirect mechanisms. Integration of HBV DNA into the host genome occurs at early steps of clonal tumour expansion, and it has been shown to induce direct insertional mutagenesis of diverse cancer-related genes in a number of cases. Chronic liver inflammation and hepatic regeneration induced by cellular immune responses may favour the accumulation of genetic alterations in infected hepatocytes. Prolonged expression of the viral regulatory protein HBx and the large envelope protein LHBs may contribute in deregulating the cellular transcription program and proliferation control, and sensitize liver cells to carcinogenic factors. Recent genetic studies have provided insight into the mechanisms underlying viral-associated hepatocarcinogenesis. It has been shown that the rate of chromosomal alterations is significantly increased in HBV-related tumours compared with tumours associated with other risk factors. HBV might therefore play a role in enhancing genomic instability. Inactivation of p53 by mutations and regional allelic deletions is found more frequently in tumours associated with HBV infection. By contrast, HBV related tumours harbour a low rate of beta-catenin mutations. Together, these data strongly support the notion that chronic HBV infection might trigger specific oncogenic pathways, thus playing a role beyond stimulation of host immune responses and chronic necro-inflammatory liver disease.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16461228"},{"text":"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are the most important causes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), accounting for the majority of the cases worldwide.

The presence of cirrhosis is a major risk factor for the development of HCC. However, HCC can occur in the absence of cirrhosis, suggesting that both HBV and HCV may be directly involved in hepatocarcinogenesis. Several HBV factors have been implicated in hepatocarcinogenesis, including the HBx gene, the pre-S2\/S gene and the HBV spliced protein.

Some studies have shown that myopic eyes undergo a hyperopic shift after the age of 40 or 45 years, whereas others have provided evidence for a myopic shift. In this paper, we report the results of both a cross-sectional study and a retrospective longitudinal study of age-related changes in refraction during the presbyopic years. METHODS: In the cross-sectional study, refractive error data were tabulated for the right eyes of 559 patients over the age of 45 years, who had been examined during a 17-month period in an established optometric practice. In the longitudinal study, we tabulated refractive error data on 100 myopes, 100 hyperopes and 100 emmetropes, who had been examined for periods varying from 10 to 26 years after age 40, all of whom had 6\/6 visual acuity at all examinations. RESULTS: In the cross-sectional study, the prevalence of myopia during the later presbyopic years was found to be greater when eyes with all visual acuities were included than when only eyes with acuity of 6\/6 or better were considered. In the longitudinal study, it was found that almost all hyperopic and emmetropic eyes showed an age-related hyperopic shift; but only a small proportion of myopic eyes shifted toward hyperopia, with others remaining relatively stable and still others increasing in myopia. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that when healthy myopic, hyperopic, or emmetropic eyes shift in the hyperopic direction, it is because of an age-related decrease in the gradient index of the lens; but when healthy myopic eyes shift in the myopic direction, it is because of axial elongation that more than compensates for the decrease in the gradient index of the lens. Another possible cause of a myopic shift, even for eyes having 6\/6 visual acuity, is the presence of early, sub-clinical nuclear sclerosis.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12482270"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10892850","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12482270"],"type":"yesno","exact_answer":"no","ideal_answer":"In summary, while myopia and hyperopia are both common refractive errors, there isn't a direct relationship between myopia and a decreased risk for later hyperopia.

To address this problem, we studied 24 individual assessment scores, including physics-based energy functions, statistical potentials, and machine learning-based scoring functions. Individual scores were also used to construct approximately 85,000 composite scoring functions using support vector machine (SVM) regression. The scores were tested for their abilities to identify the most native-like models from a set of 6000 comparative models of 20 representative protein structures. Each of the 20 targets was modeled using a template of <30% sequence identity, corresponding to challenging comparative modeling cases. The best SVM score outperformed all individual scores by decreasing the average RMSD difference between the model identified as the best of the set and the model with the lowest RMSD (DeltaRMSD) from 0.63 A to 0.45 A, while having a higher Pearson correlation coefficient to RMSD (r=0.87) than any other tested score. The most accurate score is based on a combination of the DOPE non-hydrogen atom statistical potential; surface, contact, and combined statistical potentials from MODPIPE; and two PSIPRED\/DSSP scores. It was implemented in the SVMod program, which can now be applied to select the final model in various modeling problems, including fold assignment, target-template alignment, and loop modeling.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16751606"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16751606"],"type":"summary","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":"Recognizing conserved motifs in proteins involves identifying short amino acid sequences or patterns that are evolutionarily conserved across different species or within a protein family.

T., et al. (1999) Biochemistry 38, 952]. A general acid-base mechanism has been proposed whereby His187 facilitates leaving group departure by protonating the O2 of uracil and Asp64 activates a water molecule for nucleophilic attack at C1' of the deoxyribose. Detailed kinetic studies on the H187Q, H187A, and D64N mutant enzymes indicate that Asp64 and His187 stabilize the chemical transition state by 5.3 and 4.8 kcal\/mol, respectively, with little effect on substrate or product binding. The pH dependence of k(cat) for wild-type and H187Q UDG indicates that an unprotonated group in the enzyme-substrate complex (pK(a) = 6.2 +\/- 0.2) is required for catalysis. This unprotonated group has a small DeltaH of ionization (-0.4 +\/- 1.7 kcal\/mol) and is absent in the pH profile for D64N UDG, suggesting that it corresponds to the general base Asp64. The pH dependence of k(cat) for wild-type, H187Q, and D64N UDG shows no evidence for an essential protonated group over the pH range of 5.5-10. Hence, the pK(a) of His187 must be outside this pH range if it serves as an electrophilic catalyst. These results support a mechanism in which Asp64 serves as the general base and His187 acts as a neutral electrophile, stabilizing a developing negative charge on uracil O2 in the transition state. In the following paper of this issue we establish by crystallography and heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy that the imidazole of His187 is neutral during the catalytic cycle of UDG.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10508389"},{"text":"Enzymatic transformations of macromolecular substrates such as DNA repair enzyme\/DNA transformations are commonly interpreted primarily by active-site functional-group chemistry that ignores their extensive interfaces. Yet human uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG), an archetypical enzyme that initiates DNA base-excision repair, efficiently excises the damaged base uracil resulting from cytosine deamination even when active-site functional groups are deleted by mutagenesis. The 1.8-A resolution substrate analogue and 2.0-A resolution cleaved product cocrystal structures of UDG bound to double-stranded DNA suggest enzyme-DNA substrate-binding energy from the macromolecular interface is funneled into catalytic power at the active site. The architecturally stabilized closing of UDG enforces distortions of the uracil and deoxyribose in the flipped-out nucleotide substrate that are relieved by glycosylic bond cleavage in the product complex. This experimentally defined substrate stereochemistry implies the enzyme alters the orientation of three orthogonal electron orbitals to favor electron transpositions for glycosylic bond cleavage. By revealing the coupling of this anomeric effect to a delocalization of the glycosylic bond electrons into the uracil aromatic system, this structurally implicated mechanism resolves apparent paradoxes concerning the transpositions of electrons among orthogonal orbitals and the retention of catalytic efficiency despite mutational removal of active-site functional groups. These UDG\/DNA structures and their implied dissociative excision chemistry suggest biology favors a chemistry for base-excision repair initiation that optimizes pathway coordination by product binding to avoid the release of cytotoxic and mutagenic intermediates. Similar excision chemistry may apply to other biological reaction pathways requiring the coordination of complex multistep chemical transformations.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10805771"},{"text":"DNA glycosylases are the enzymes responsible for recognizing base lesions in the genome and initiating base excision DNA repair.

This clock gene machinery steers daily oscillations in the regulation of immune cell activity, driving the periodicity in immune system function. The transcriptional networks that regulate temporal variation in gene expression in immunocompetent cells and tissues respond to diverse physiological clues, addressing well-timed adjustments of transcription and translation processes. Nuclear receptors comprise a unique class of transcriptional regulators that are capable of gauging hormones, metabolites, endobiotics and xenobiotics, linking ligand sensing to transcriptional responses in various cell types through switching between coactivator and corepressor recruitment. The expression of coregulators is highly responsive to physiological signals, and plays an important role in the control of rhythmic patterns of gene expression, optimizing the switch between nycthemeral patterns, and synchronizing circadian rhythmicity with changing physiological demands across the light-dark cycle.

The master circadian clock, localized in suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), regulates multiple metabolic pathways, while feeding behavior and metabolite availability can in turn regulate the circadian clock.

Maintenance of the glucose homeostasis is particularly important for the proper function of the body, as this sugar is the main source of energy for the brain, retina, erythrocytes and skeletal muscles. Thus, glucose production and utilization are synchronized in time. The hypothalamic excited orexin neurons control energy balance of organism and modulate the glucose production and utilization.

We found that both Plasmodium falciparum HZ and synthetic HZ increase mRNA levels of various chemokine transcripts (MIP-1alpha\/CCL3, MIP-1beta\/CCL4, MIP-2\/CXCL2, and MCP-1\/CCL2) in murine B10R Mphi. The cellular response to HZ involved ERK1\/2 phosphorylation, NF-kappaB activation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and ROS-dependent protein-tyrosine phosphatase down-regulation. Selective inhibition of either IkappaBalpha or the ERK1\/2 pathway abolished both NF-kappaB activation and chemokine up-regulation. Similarly, blockage of HZ-inducible Mphi ROS with superoxide dismutase suppressed chemokine induction, strongly reduced NF-kappaB activation, and restored HZ-mediated Mphi protein-tyrosine phosphatase inactivation. In contrast, superoxide dismutase had no effect on EKR1\/2 phosphorylation by HZ.

Differential glyphosate spray retention and foliar uptake of applied (14)C-glyphosate between the R (C004) and S biotype had no effect on resistance to this herbicide. Quantitative and qualitative tests showed greater (14)C-glyphosate mobility in the S biotype than in the R (C004) biotype. Glyphosate was metabolized faster in the R (C004) biotype than in the S biotype.

This process is subject to reversible corruption by fluoroquinolones, antibacterials that form drug-enzyme-DNA complexes in which the DNA is broken. The complexes, called cleaved complexes because of the presence of DNA breaks, have been crystallized and found to have the fluoroquinolone C-7 ring system facing the GyrB\/ParE subunits. As expected from x-ray crystallography, a thiol-reactive, C-7-modified chloroacetyl derivative of ciprofloxacin (Cip-AcCl) formed cross-linked cleaved complexes with mutant GyrB-Cys(466) gyrase as evidenced by resistance to reversal by both EDTA and thermal treatments. Surprisingly, cross-linking was also readily seen with complexes formed by mutant GyrA-G81C gyrase, thereby revealing a novel drug-gyrase interaction not observed in crystal structures. The cross-link between fluoroquinolone and GyrA-G81C gyrase correlated with exceptional bacteriostatic activity for Cip-AcCl with a quinolone-resistant GyrA-G81C variant of Escherichia coli and its Mycobacterium smegmatis equivalent (GyrA-G89C). Cip-AcCl-mediated, irreversible inhibition of DNA replication provided further evidence for a GyrA-drug cross-link.

The effects appear greatest in those initially traumatized in early life, implying a degree of developmental programming, perhaps of both lower cortisol and vulnerability to psychopathology. In these conditions, lowered cortisol is not due to any adrenal or pituitary insufficiency. Instead, two processes appear involved. First, there is increased target cell sensitivity to glucocorticoid action, notably negative feedback upon the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (stress) axis. Altered density of the glucocorticoid receptor is inferred, squaring with much preclinical data showing early life challenges can permanently program glucocorticoid receptors in a tissue-specific manner. These effects involve epigenetic mechanisms. Second, early life trauma\/starvation induces long-lasting lowering of glucocorticoid catabolism, specifically by 5\u03b1-reductase type 1 (predominantly a liver enzyme) and 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (in kidney), an effect also seen in model systems. These changes reflect a plausible early-life adaptation to increase the persistence of active cortisol in liver (to maximize fuel output) and kidney (to increase salt retention) without elevation of circulating levels, thus avoiding their deleterious effects on brain and muscle. Modestly lowered circulating cortisol and increased vulnerability to stress-associated disorders may be the outcome.

Using GFP-tagged endosomal markers, we monitored an endosomal compartment in Drosophila neuromuscular synapses. We showed that in conditions in which the synaptic vesicles pool is depleted, the endosome is also drastically reduced and only recovers from membrane derived by dynamin-mediated endocytosis. This suggests that membrane exchange takes place between the vesicle pool and the synaptic endosome.

{"body":"What is the mechanism of oxygen uptake in E. coli?","snippets":[{"text":"Clostridium perfringens is the most common cause of gas gangrene (clostridial myonecrosis), a disease that begins when ischaemic tissues become contaminated with C. perfringens vegetative cells or spores. An aerotolerant anaerobe, C. perfringens quickly multiplies in ischaemic tissues and spreads to healthy areas, leading to a high level of morbidity and mortality. As a species, the bacterium can synthesize 13 different toxins, and these are thought to be the major virulence factors of the disease. However, we present evidence here that C. perfringens can also persist inside macrophages, under aerobic conditions, by escaping the phagosome into the cytoplasm. C. perfringens was not killed by the cells of a clone (J774-33) of the macrophage-like murine cell line J774A.1 under aerobic or anaerobic conditions, whereas the non-pathogenic bacterium Bacillus subtilis was killed by J774-33 cells under both conditions. Electron microscopy images showed that C. perfringens cells were intact and resided mostly in the cytoplasm of J774-33 cells, whereas B. subtilis was in the phagosome. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that intracellular C. perfringens bacteria failed to co-localize with the late endosome-lysosomal marker glycoprotein LAMP-1, whereas B. subtilis did co-localize with LAMP-1. C. perfringens also appeared to escape the phagosome of both activated and unactivated mouse peritoneal macrophages, but not as efficiently as was seen with the J774-33 cell line. In addition, cytochalasin D was used to show that phagocytosis of C. perfringens was dependent on actin polymerization and that the bacteria attach to J774-33 cells at distinct areas of the cell membrane. We propose that the ability to escape the phagosome and persist inside macrophages is an important factor in the early stages of a gangrene infection, when bacterial numbers are low and phagocytic cells are present.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11207604"},{"text":"Acetogens were enumerated from root homogenates of the black needlerush Juncus roemerianus obtained from a nearly pristine salt marsh. An isolated colony, ST1, yielded acetogenic activity and was initially thought to be a pure culture; however, ST1 was subsequently found to be composed of an aerotolerant fermentative anaerobe (RC) and an acetogen (RS(T)) ((T) indicates type strain). The two spore-forming mesophiles were separated by selective cultivation under conditions favouring the growth of either RC or RS(T). The 16S rRNA gene sequence of RC was 99 % similar to that of Clostridium intestinale, indicating that RC was a new isolate of this clostridial species. The rRNA gene sequence most similar to that of RS(T) was only 96 % similar to that of RS(T) and was from a species of the acetogenic genus Sporomusa, indicating that RS(T) was a new sporomusal species; the name Sporomusa rhizae sp. nov. is proposed. RC grew at the expense of saccharides. H(2)-forming butyrate fermentation was the primary catabolism utilized by RC under anoxic conditions, while homolactate fermentation was the primary catabolism under oxic conditions. RC consumed O(2) and tolerated 20 % O(2) in the headspace of shaken broth cultures. In contrast, RS(T) was acetogenic, utilized H(2), lactate and formate, did not utilize saccharides, and could not tolerate high concentrations of O(2). RS(T) grew by trophic interaction with RC on saccharides via the uptake of H(2), and, to a lesser extent, lactate and formate produced by RC. Co-cultures of the two organisms yielded high amounts of acetate. These results indicate that (i) previously uncharacterized species of Sporomusa are associated with Juncus roots and (ii) trophic links to O(2)-consuming aerotolerant anaerobes might contribute to the in situ activities and survival strategies of acetogens in salt marsh rhizospheres, a habitat subject to gradients of plant-derived O(2).","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16549683"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11207604","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16549683"],"type":"summary","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":"In summary, E. coli uptakes oxygen through passive diffusion across the cell membrane and utilizes oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor in its respiratory chain to generate ATP through oxidative phosphorylation.

Our results constitute a novel example connecting the selective fixation of specific nucleotides in nature to their precisely determined phenotypic effects. We also present evidence suggesting that a recently derived ventral orange luciferase allele on the island has deterministically increased in frequency.

In the resident-intruder test, the rate of mice that exhibited aggressive behavior to the total mice was significantly higher in isolated zinc-deficient mice than in isolated control mice. The duration of aggressive behavior was more in isolated zinc-deficient mice. These results indicate that aggressive behavior of young mice elicited by social isolation is enhanced by zinc deficiency. On the other hand, social isolation-induced aggressive behavior was enhanced in isolated pair-fed mice with food restriction that can activate the HPA axis. Serum corticosterone concentration was also significantly higher in isolated zinc-deficient mice. To see the effect of the increased serum corticosterone on behavioral abnormality, neurotransmitter concentrations in brain tissue were checked. The concentrations of glutamate and GABA in brain tissue were significantly higher in both grouped and isolated zinc-deficient mice. Furthermore, the concentration of extracellular glutamate in the amygdala before the resident-intruder test was significantly higher in isolated zinc-deficient (aggressive) mice and the higher concentration was maintained during the test.

At high magnification, the chromatid was seen to be produced by the compaction of highly twisted chromatin fiber loops, and its compaction tended to be stronger in the ridged regions of the chromosomes than in the grooved regions. Our AFM studies also showed the presence of catenation of chromatin fibers between the ridged portions of the chromatid in the late metaphase.

The primary results in this area have come from organisms that share the traits of a visibly asymmetric division and an identifiable juvenile phase. As reproductive aging must require a differential distribution of aged and young components between parent and offspring, it has been postulated that organisms without these traits do not age, thus exhibiting functional immortality. Through automated time-lapse microscopy, we followed repeated cycles of reproduction by individual cells of the model organism Escherichia coli, which reproduces without a juvenile phase and with an apparently symmetric division. We show that the cell that inherits the old pole exhibits a diminished growth rate, decreased offspring production, and an increased incidence of death. We conclude that the two supposedly identical cells produced during cell division are functionally asymmetric; the old pole cell should be considered an aging parent repeatedly producing rejuvenated offspring. These results suggest that no life strategy is immune to the effects of aging, and therefore immortality may be either too costly or mechanistically impossible in natural organisms.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15685293"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15685293"],"type":"yesno","exact_answer":"no","ideal_answer":"Bacteria do not undergo senescence or age in the same way that multicellular organisms do."}
{"body":"What is meant by drug tolerance?","snippets":[{"text":"Despite the existence of a large body of information on the subject, the mechanisms of opiate tolerance and dependence are not yet fully understood. Although the traditional mechanisms of receptor down-regulation and desensitization seem to play a role, they cannot entirely explain the phenomena of tolerance and dependence. Therefore, other mechanisms, such as the presence of antiopiate systems and the coupling of opiate receptors to alternative G-proteins, should be considered. A further complication of studies of opiate tolerance and dependence is the multiplicity of endogenous opiate receptors and peptides. This review will focus on the endogenous opioid system--peptides, receptors, and coupling of receptors to intracellular signaling via G-proteins--in the context of their roles in tolerance and dependence. Opioid peptides include the recently discovered endomorphins and those encoded by three known genes--pro-opiomelanocortin, pro-enkephalin, and pro-dynorphin. They bind to three types of receptors--mu, delta, and kappa. Each of the receptor types is further divided into multiple subtypes. These receptors are widely known to be coupled to G-proteins of the Gi and Go subtypes, but an increasing body of results suggests coupling to other G-proteins, such as Gs. The coupling of opiate receptors to Gs, in particular, has implications for tolerance and dependence. Alterations at the receptor and transduction level have been the focus of many studies of opiate tolerance and dependence. In these studies, both receptor down-regulation and desensitization have been demonstrated in vivo and in vitro. Receptor down-regulation has been more easily observed in vitro, especially in response to morphine, a phenomenon which suggests that some factor which is missing in vitro prevents receptors from down-regulating in vivo and may play a critical role in tolerance and dependence. We suggest that antiopiate peptides may operate in vivo in this capacity, and we outline the evidence for the antiopiate properties of three peptides: neuropeptide FF, orphanin FQ\/nociceptin, and Tyr-W-MIF-1. In addition, we provide new results suggesting that Tyr-W-MIF-1 may act as an antiopiate at the cellular level by inhibiting basal G-protein activation, in contrast to the activation of G-proteins by opiate agonists.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9864069"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9864069"],"type":"summary","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":"In summary, drug tolerance is a complex phenomenon characterized by reduced responsiveness to a drug following repeated or prolonged use.

Although agonist treatment generally does not affect transcription of mor, previous studies suggest that morphine can affect the translation efficiency of MOR transcript via microRNAs (miRNAs). On the basis of miRNA microarray analyses of the hippocampal total RNA isolated from mice chronically treated with \u03bc-opioid agonists, we found a miRNA (miR-339-3p) that was consistently and specifically increased by morphine (2-fold) and by fentanyl (3.8-fold). miR-339-3p bound to the MOR 3'-UTR and specifically suppressed reporter activity. Suppression was blunted by adding miR-339-3p inhibitor or mutating the miR-339-3p target site. In cells endogenously expressing MOR, miR-339-3p inhibited the production of MOR protein by destabilizing MOR mRNA. Up-regulation of miR-339-3p by fentanyl (EC(50)=0.75 nM) resulted from an increase in primary miRNA transcript. Mapping of the miR-339-3p primary RNA and its promoter revealed that the primary miR-339-3p was embedded in a noncoding 3'-UTR region of an unknown host gene and was coregulated by the host promoter. The identified promoter was activated by opioid agonist treatment (10 nM fentanyl or 10 \u03bcM morphine), a specific effect blocked by the opioid antagonist naloxone (10 \u03bcM). Taken together, these results suggest that miR-339-3p may serve as a negative feedback modulator of MOR signals by regulating intracellular MOR biosynthesis.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23085997"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23085997"],"type":"summary","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":"Overall, tachyphylaxis is a complex phenomenon that can involve multiple molecular mechanisms, including receptor desensitization, downregulation of receptor expression, feedback inhibition, metabolic tolerance, and cellular adaptation.

Additional increments may come from extrinsic factors such as ligands or specific compatible solutes. Apart from the enthalpic effects, entropy may play a role by reducing the flexibility (cystine bridges, increased proline content), or by water release from residues buried upon folding and association. Additional quaternary interactions and closer packing are typical characteristics of proteins from thermophiles. In halophiles, protein stability and function are maintained by increased ion binding and glutamic acid content, both allowing the protein inventory to compete for water at high salt. Acidophiles and alkalophiles show neutral intracellular pH; proteins facing the outside extremes of pH possess anomalously high contents in ionizable amino acids. Global comparisons of the amino acid compositions and sequences of proteins from mesophiles and extremophiles did not result in general rules of protein stabilization, even after including complete genome sequences into the search. Obviously, proteins are individuals that optimize internal packing and external solvent interactions by very different mechanisms, each protein in its own way.

From the analysis of the thermodynamic parameters for these ubiquitin variants we conclude that: (i) packing of non-polar groups in the protein interior is favorable and is largely defined by a favorable enthalpy of van der Waals interactions. The removal of one methylene group from the protein interior will destabilize a protein by approximately 5 kJ\/mol, and will decrease the enthalpy of a protein by 12 kJ\/mol. (ii) Burial of polar groups in the non-polar interior of a protein is highly destabilizing, and the degree of destabilization depends on the relative polarity of this group. For example, burial of Thr side-chain in the non-polar interior will be less destabilizing than burial of Asn side-chain. This decrease in stability is defined by a large enthalpy of dehydration of polar groups upon burial.

Using the surface force apparatus, we have directly measured the interaction energy between monolayers of lipids whose headgroups can establish hydrogen bonds in water: nitrilotriacetate, adenosine, thymidine, and methylated thymidine lipids. From the adhesion energy between the surfaces, we have deduced the energy of a single hydrogen bond in water. We found in each case an energy of 0.5 kcal\/mol.

Using the \"double mutant cycle\" analysis, the strength of the pairwise interactions between K11 and E34 was estimated to be favorable by 3.6kJ\/mol. Further, the salt bridge of the reverse orientation, i.e. E11\/K34, can be formed and is found to have a strength (3.8kJ\/mol) similar to that of the K11\/E34 pair.

The difference in the contribution of the opposing salt bridge orientations to the overall stability of the ubiquitin molecule is attributed to the difference in the charge-charge interactions between residues forming the salt bridge and the rest of the ionizable groups in this protein. On the basis of these results, we concluded that surface salt bridges are stabilizing, but their contribution to the overall protein stability is strongly context-dependent, with charge-charge interactions being the largest determinant.

As such, it is imperative to understand as much as possible about how a protein loses stability and to what extent we can control this through the thermal environment as well as through chemical or mechanical modification of the protein environment. This review presents an overview of protein stability in terms of denaturation due to temperature alteration (predominantly high and some low) and its modification by use of chemical additives, pH modification as well as modification of the mechanical environment (stress) of the proteins such as collagen. These modifiers are able to change the kinetics of protein denaturation during heating. While pH can affect the activation energy (or activation enthalpy) and the frequency factor (or activation entropy) of the denaturation kinetics, many other chemical and mechanical modifiers only affect the frequency factor (activation entropy). Often, the modification affecting activation entropy appears to be linked to the hydration of the protein. While the heat-induced denaturation of proteins is reasonably well understood, the heat denaturation of structural proteins (e.g., collagen) within whole tissues remains an area of active research. In addition, while some literature exists on protein denaturation during cold temperatures, relatively little is known about the kinetics of protein denaturation during both freezing and drying. Further understanding of this kinetics will have an important impact on applications ranging from preservation of biomaterials and pharmaceutics to cryosurgery. Interestingly, both freezing and drying involve drastic shifts in the hydration of the proteins. It is clear that understanding protein hydration at the molecular, cellular, and tissue level will be important to the future of this evolving area.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16533916"},{"text":"A model of hydrophobic collapse, which is treated as the driving force for protein folding, is presented.

These three models together helped to develop the idea of a fuzzy-oil-drop as a model for an external force field of hydrophobic character mimicking the hydrophobicity-differentiated environment for hydrophobic collapse. All amino acids in the polypeptide interact pair-wise during the folding process (energy minimization procedure) and interact with the external hydrophobic force field defined by a three-dimensional Gaussian function. The value of the Gaussian function usually interpreted as a probability distribution is treated as a normalized hydrophobicity distribution, with its maximum in the center of the ellipsoid and decreasing proportionally with the distance versus the center.

Nevertheless, while backbone hydrogen bonds may be much stronger in membrane proteins, experimental measurements indicate that side chain hydrogen bond strengths are not strikingly different in membrane and water soluble proteins. How is this possible? I argue that model compounds in apolar solvents do not adequately describe the system because the protein itself is ignored.

Here, we realized this goal by applying mutagenesis and chemical modification on a set of disordered peptides and proteins. We measured the protein dimensions and kinetics of intra-chain diffusion of modified polypeptides at the level of individual molecules using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, thereby avoiding artifacts commonly caused by aggregation of unfolded protein material in bulk. We found no contributions from side chains to collapse but, instead, identified backbone interactions as a source sufficient to form globules of native-like dimensions. The presence of backbone hydrogen bonds decreased polypeptide water solubility dramatically and accelerated the nanosecond kinetics of loop closure, in agreement with recent predictions from computer simulation. The presence of side chains, instead, slowed loop closure and modulated the dimensions of intrinsically disordered domains.

Part of this heterogeneity arises from the diversity of the DNA ends, but much of it arises from the many alternative ways in which the nuclease, polymerases, and ligase can act during NHEJ.

{"body":"What controls gut motility?","snippets":[{"text":"Opium is arguably one of the oldest herbal medicines, being used as analgesic, sedative and antidiarrheal drug for thousands of years. These effects mirror the actions of the endogenous opioid system and are mediated by the principal mu-, kappa- and delta-opioid receptors. In the gut, met-enkephalin, leu-enkephalin, beta-endorphin and dynorphin occur in both neurons and endocrine cells. When released, opioid peptides activate opioid receptors on the enteric circuitry controlling motility and secretion. As a result, inhibition of gastric emptying, increase in sphincter tone, induction of stationary motor patterns and blockade of peristalsis ensue. Together with inhibition of ion and fluid secretion, these effects cause constipation, one of the most frequent and troublesome adverse reactions of opioid analgesic therapy. Although laxatives are most frequently used to ameliorate opioid-induced bowel dysfunction, their efficacy is unsatisfactory. Specific antagonism of peripheral opioid receptors is a more rational approach. This goal is addressed by the use of opioid receptor antagonists with limited absorption such as oral prolonged-release naloxone and opioid receptor antagonists that do not penetrate the blood-brain barrier such as methylnaltrexone and alvimopan. Preliminary evidence indicates that peripherally restricted opioid receptor antagonists may act as prokinetic drugs in their own right.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19345246"},{"text":"Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) participates in several functions of the gastrointestinal tract.

The basic pathology and cause are relatively well known to human divers. Breath-hold diving marine mammals were thought to be relatively immune to DCS owing to multiple anatomical, physiological and behavioural adaptations that reduce nitrogen gas (N(2)) loading during dives. However, recent observations have shown that gas bubbles may form and tissue injury may occur in marine mammals under certain circumstances. Gas kinetic models based on measured time-depth profiles further suggest the potential occurrence of high blood and tissue N(2) tensions. We review evidence for gas-bubble incidence in marine mammal tissues and discuss the theory behind gas loading and bubble formation. We suggest that diving mammals vary their physiological responses according to multiple stressors, and that the perspective on marine mammal diving physiology should change from simply minimizing N(2) loading to management of the N(2) load. This suggests several avenues for further study, ranging from the effects of gas bubbles at molecular, cellular and organ function levels, to comparative studies relating the presence\/absence of gas bubbles to diving behaviour.

As such, editing complicates the Clonal Selection Hypothesis because edited cells are not simply endowed for life with a single, invariant antigen receptor. Furthermore, if the initial immunoglobulin gene is not inactivated during the editing process, allelic exclusion is violated and the B cell can exhibit two specificities.

This feature may reflect a preference for the kappa locus by the recombinase machinery, or it may indicate that kappa rearrangement begins before lambda rearrangement. These possibilities can be distinguished by measuring the kinetics with which light chain gene rearrangement at both loci actually occurs. To this end, we have used pre-B cells transformed by temperature-sensitive mutants of Abelson virus that undergo kappa and lambda gene rearrangement when shifted to the nonpermissive temperature. Competitive PCR analyses of rearrangement kinetics demonstrate that the kappa and lambda loci rearrange at about the same time in these cells. Consistent with this, some clones isolated from cells induced for a short period of time have rearranged only the lambda locus. However, the frequency with which lambda genes are rearranged is three- to sixfold lower than that with which kappa genes rearrange. These data indicate that the recombinase machinery targets both light chain loci at the same time, but acts preferentially at the kappa locus. The reduced ability of the recombinase machinery to target the lambda locus and selection pressures occurring during B cell development probably both contribute to the preferential usage of kappa genes in normal murine B lineage cells.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9550405"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21251012","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9550405"],"type":"summary","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":"Overall, BCR editing is a critical process in B cell development that ensures the generation of a diverse repertoire of B cells with non-self-reactive BCRs while maintaining self-tolerance and preventing autoimmunity.

{"body":"Apoptosis vs necroptosis","snippets":[{"text":"Emergence of castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer is due to activation of survival pathways, including apoptosis suppression and anoikis resistance, and increased neovascularization. Thus targeting of apoptotic players is of critical significance in prostate cancer therapy since loss of apoptosis and resistance to anoikis are critical in aberrant malignant growth, metastasis and conferring therapeutic failure. The majority of therapeutic agents act through intrinsic mitochondrial, extrinsic death receptor pathways or endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways to induce apoptosis. Current therapeutic strategies target restoring regulatory molecules that govern the pro-survival pathways such as PTEN which regulates AKT activity. Other strategies focus on reactivating the apoptotic pathways either by down-regulating anti-apoptotic players such as BCL-2 or by up-regulating pro-apoptotic protein families, most notably, the caspases. Caspases are a family of cystine proteases which serve critical roles in apoptotic and inflammatory signaling pathways. During tumorigenesis, significant loss or inactivation of lead members in the caspase family leads to impairing apoptosis induction, causing a dramatic imbalance in the growth dynamics, ultimately resulting in aberrant growth of human cancers. Recent exploitation of apoptosis pathways towards re-instating apoptosis induction via caspase re-activation has provided new molecular platforms for the development of therapeutic strategies effective against advanced prostate cancer as well as other solid tumors.

In mixed cerebellar cultures of primary neurons, astrocytes, and microglia, LPS induced neuronal loss that was prevented by inhibition of caspase-8 (resulting in microglial necroptosis), and neuronal death was restored by rescue of microglia with necrostatin-1.

This study was designed to determine whether the SVZ and RMS of the postnatal primate also harbor a specialized population of neuronal progenitors with the capacity to divide while they migrate. In order to reveal the spatial-temporal changes in the distribution and composition of the neuronal progenitor cells in the primate SVZ and RMS, seven rhesus monkeys, ranging in age from 2 days to 8 years, were given a single injection of the cell proliferation marker bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) 3 h before they were perfused. The phenotypic identity of the BrdU(+) cells was revealed by double labeling sagittal sections with cell type-specific markers. From birth onward the distribution of BrdU(+) cells with a neuronal phenotype is extensive and largely overlapping with that of the rodent. Similar to the rodent brain the neuronal progenitors are most numerous in neonates. The BrdU(+) neurons in the primate forebrain extend lateral and ventral to the lateral ventricle and all along the RMS. The cytoarchitectonic arrangement and appearance of the neuronal progenitor cells is quite varied in the primate compared to the rodent; in some locations the cells are aligned in parallel arrays resembling the neuronal chains of the adult rodent RMS, whereas in other positions the cells have a homogeneous \"honeycomb\" arrangement. The chains are progressively more pervasive in older primates. Akin to the RMS of adult rodents, in the primate SVZ and RMS the astrocytes often form long tubes enveloping the chains of neuronal progenitors.

Since Li-treatment can produce a form of hyperparathyroidism and parathyroid hormone (PTH) can act as a partial agonist to AVP, in vivo and in vitro studies were performed on rats made polyuric by daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) Li (4 mmol\/kg) treatment. Li-treatment for three weeks produced an increase in PTH (194 +\/- 20 compared with 118 +\/- 18 pg\/ml in control rats; P < 0.01) as well as an increase in the plasma calcium concentration (2.38 +\/- 0.05 compared with 2.25 +\/- 0.04 mmol\/liter; P < 0.05). Clearance studies were performed on water loaded Li-treated and control rats, and the defect in urine concentration was only observed with a low physiological concentration of AVP (10 mU\/kg body wt over 5 min). Maximal urine osmolality was 328 +\/- 31 compared with 613 +\/- 81 mOsm\/kg (P < 0.05) in controls. There was no detectable difference with a prolonged maximal physiological AVP concentration (10 mU bolus and 50 mU\/kg body wt per hr) and papillary solute concentrations were unchanged. When Li-treated rats had been parathyroidectomized (PTX), a significant difference in urine concentration with the low AVP concentration could not be demonstrated when compared to non-PTX control rats. In the isolated papillary collecting duct preparation a medium was used that contained fresh plasma from Li-treated or control rats, both intact and PTX. Experiments using plasma from Li-treated intact rats produced only a 25.4 +\/- 5.1% increase in diffusional water permeability with the addition of AVP (200 microU\/ml) compared to 52.6 +\/- 9.0% in control rats (P < 0.01). However, when plasma from Li-treated PTX rats was used, the AVP induced increase in water permeability (54.7 +\/- 11.2%) was not significantly different from that observed in PTX control rats. These studies show that the NDI-like defect in Li-treatment is small and easily overcome by higher concentrations of AVP and suggests that the concentration defect is at least in part due to increased circulating levels of PTH acting as a partial agonist to AVP and thereby inhibiting its hydroosmotic action.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8840263"}],"documents":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8840263"],"type":"summary","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":"Overall, lithium-induced polyuria is likely multifactorial, involving a combination of effects on renal water channels, hormonal regulation, renal tubular function, and renal hemodynamics.

To investigate if differences exist in the expansion patterns of TF gene families between plants and other eukaryotes, we first used Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) TFs to identify TF DNA-binding domains. These DNA-binding domains were then used to identify related sequences in 25 other eukaryotic genomes. Interestingly, among 19 families that are shared between animals and plants, more than 14 are larger in plants than in animals. After examining the lineage-specific expansion of TF families in two plants, eight animals, and two fungi, we found that TF families shared among these organisms have undergone much more dramatic expansion in plants than in other eukaryotes. Moreover, this elevated expansion rate of plant TF is not simply due to higher duplication rates of plant genomes but also to a higher degree of expansion compared to other plant genes. Further, in many Arabidopsis-rice (Oryza sativa) TF orthologous groups, the degree of lineage-specific expansion in Arabidopsis is correlated with that in rice. This pattern of parallel expansion is much more pronounced than the whole-genome trend in rice and Arabidopsis.

These optimization approaches aim to enhance gene expression, protein production, and functional activity by modifying the coding sequence to better match the codon usage preferences and translational machinery of the host organism."}
{"body":"What is sensory adaptation?","snippets":null,"documents":null,"type":"summary","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":"Sensory adaptation refers to the process by which sensory receptors become less responsive or sensitive to constant or repetitive stimuli over time. It is a fundamental aspect of sensory processing that allows organisms to focus attention on relevant or changing stimuli while filtering out irrelevant or static information. Sensory adaptation occurs across all sensory modalities, including vision, hearing, touch, taste, and smell, and it plays a crucial role in shaping perception and behavior."}
{"body":"What is environmental robustness?","snippets":null,"documents":null,"type":"summary","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":"Environmental robustness refers to the ability of a biological system, organism, or process to maintain stable and functional performance despite changes or fluctuations in environmental conditions. In other words, it is the capacity of a system to withstand perturbations, variations, or stresses in its surroundings without losing its integrity or functionality. Environmental robustness is a key concept in biology and engineering, as it reflects the adaptability, resilience, and survival capability of living organisms and engineered systems in dynamic and unpredictable environments."}
