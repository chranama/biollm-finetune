Surgical resection remains the standard therapy for patients with colorectal liver metastases. Among these conditions, pre- and postoperative management plays a key role. In particular, the current article highlights the importance of liver transplantation in very advanced cases of subacute liver failure due to insufficient functional liver parenchyma and toxicity of chemotherapy.

            "The prognosis of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients after liver metastasis resection is influenced by several clinical conditions. A study using data from the SEER database found that age, number and size of liver metastases, and lymph node status of the primary tumor are important prognostic factors. In a national registry study in Sweden, lymph node status, multiple sites of metastasis, high ASA grade, and postoperative complications after resection of the primary tumor were identified as risk factors for worse survival. Another retrospective analysis of patients treated at the Liaoning Cancer Hospital and Institute in China found that the degree of tumor differentiation, number and size of metastases, and proximity to major vessels are significant prognostic factors. In a study of patients who experienced recurrence following hepatectomy for CRC metastases, shorter time to recurrence, node-positive primary tumor, and more than one site of recurrence were associated with worse outcomes. These studies suggest that a comprehensive assessment of multiple clinical factors is necessary to accurately predict the prognosis of CRC patients after liver metastasis resection.",

The number of hepatic metastases and the surgical margin are the most important prognostic factors. Patients with four or more metastatic nodules in the liver have a poor prognosis. Other prognostic factors include the size of the lesions, the presence of extra-hepatic disease, the time interval between the resection of the primary tumor and the appearance of liver metastases, and the level of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA).

Resection margins: Clear surgical margins of at least 10 mm are associated with improved survival. \n\n3. Presence of extrahepatic metastases: Metastatic disease confined to the liver has better outcomes than cancer spread to other organs.\n\n4. Preoperative CEA levels: Normal carcinoembryonic antigen levels before surgery are a positive prognostic factor.\n\n5. Timing of metastases: Metachronous metastases appearing more than 2 years after primary colorectal tumor resection have better prognosis than synchronous metastases.\n\n6. Chemotherapy: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy to downsize metastases and adjuvant chemotherapy after resection may improve outcomes, although still debated.\n\n7. Patient health and liver function: The patient must be medically fit to tolerate major liver resection surgery.\n\nIn summary, key prognostic determinants include the number, size, and distribution of metastases, evidence of extrahepatic spread, tumor biology markers like CEA, and the patient's overall health status and liver function.

Activation of alternative angiogenic pathways that are independent of VEGF, such as through fibroblast growth factor (FGF) or hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) signaling. These compensatory pathways can sustain tumor vascularization and growth despite VEGF inhibition.\n\n2. VEGF-dependent alterations, such as increased VEGF expression by tumor cells to overwhelm bevacizumab or changes in VEGF receptors that make them less responsive to the drug.\n\n3. Interactions between tumor cells and stromal cells in the microenvironment that promote angiogenesis, such as recruitment of pro-angiogenic bone marrow-derived cells.\n\nIn summary, tumors can adapt and restore angiogenesis through alternative signaling pathways, modulation of the VEGF pathway itself, and interactions with the tumor microenvironment, all of which can contribute to bevacizumab resistance and enable tumor growth and progression.",

Nuss Technique: This is a modification of the minimally invasive repair method, where a curved steel bar is used to reshape the chest wall and correct the deformity.\n\n3. Highly Modified Ravitch Repair: This is an open surgical technique that involves the removal of abnormal cartilage and ribs, followed by reshaping of the chest wall using sutures and/or prosthetic materials.\n\n4. Prolene Polypropylene Mesh Repair: This technique involves the use of a mesh made of polypropylene to provide support and stability to the chest wall.\n\n5.

Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is the most common complication of prematurity. It is caused by insufficient amounts of surfactant, a substance that helps the lungs expand and contract properly. Premature babies have a higher risk of developing RDS because their lungs are not fully developed and are therefore less able to produce surfactant. Surfactant replacement therapy is a common treatment for RDS, and surfactant preparations are available in a variety of",

            "Irinotecan, a plant alkaloid used in cancer treatment, causes adverse reactions, especially when administered at higher doses, in combination with other drugs or in patients with low cholinesterase activity. \nThe preventive strategy relies mainly on the administration of anticholinergics such as atropine or glycopyrrolate, preferably by infusion, before the administration of irinotecan. \nFor the management of severe toxicities, high doses of atropine are recommended and it is necessary to follow a monitoring plan of heart rate and QTc interval.",
            "A retrospective study aimed to identify predictive factors for the development of irinotecan-related cholinergic syndrome in order to improve the quality of life of patients undergoing chemotherapy. The study enrolled 150 cancer patients who underwent chemotherapy, which included irinotecan, in their outpatient chemotherapy center between October 2014 and January 2017. The results showed that scopolamine butylbromide was effective in preventing irinotecan-related cholinergic syndrome. The only risk factor associated with irinotecan-related cholinergic syndrome was the irinotecan dose (\u2265 150 mg/m2), and the incidence of cholinergic syndrome in patients with this risk factor was 75%. Therefore, prophylaxis treatments for acute cholinergic syndrome secondary to irinotecan include administering anticholinergics, such as atropine sulfate or scopolamine butylbromide, and adjusting the irinotecan dose. A study on the incidence of CPT-11 (irinotecan) related cholinergic symptoms in cancer patients found that high-dose CPT-11 administration was a significant risk factor for the appearance of cholinergic symptoms. The cholinergic syndrome is caused by the inhibition of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme by irinotecan or its metabolites, leading to an accumulation of acetylcholine and subsequent symptoms. The study also explores the potential of phytochemicals found in Phyllanthus emblica (amla) as an alternative treatment for cancer to target and inhibit the Top1 protein and identify a non-inhibitor for AChE. Prophylactic treatments for acute cholinergic syndrome secondary to irinotecan include scopolamine butylbromide.",

In particular, the most commonly affected tumor suppressor genes in GBM are p53, PTEN, p16/CDKN2, and RB, leading to activation of the PI3K/Akt and Ras/MAPK pathways, which provide targets for therapy.",
            "Based on the information provided, the most commonly affected tumor suppressor genes in glioblastoma are:\n\n1. CDKN2A/p16 - Homozygous deletions or mutations of p16 are very frequent in glioblastoma, occurring in 64-86% of cases. Loss of p16 is often accompanied by loss of the related p14ARF and p15 genes.\n\n2. RB (Retinoblastoma) - Alterations in RB are also common, though less frequent than p16. RB and p16 alterations tend to be mutually exclusive.\n\n3. PTEN - Mutations or deletions of PTEN occur in approximately 30-73% of glioblastomas, making it one of the most commonly altered genes after EGFR amplification.\n\n4. TP53 - p53 mutations are also highly prevalent, seen in over 76% of glioblastoma cell lines.\n\nIn summary, inactivation of the p16-CDK4/cyclin D-RB pathway and PTEN/PI3K signaling are key molecular events in the pathogenesis of most glioblastomas.

PTEN loss leads to overactivation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR growth-promoting pathway.\n\n3. CDKN2A (p16 and p14ARF): Homozygous deletions of CDKN2A, encoding the p16 and p14ARF cell cycle inhibitors, are found in 34-65% of glioblastomas. This allows uncontrolled cell cycle progression.\n\n4. RB1: Alterations in the retinoblastoma (RB1) pathway are common, with RB1 itself mutated in some cases. The p16-CDK4/cyclin D1-RB pathway is inactivated in the vast majority of glioblastomas.\n\nOther less commonly affected tumor suppressors include NF1 and CDKN2B (p15).\n\nIn summary, TP53, PTEN, CDKN2A, and RB1 are the most frequently mutated or deleted tumor suppressor genes in glioblastoma, leading to the loss of critical cell cycle control and growth regulation."

Another study published in the journal Gut found that KRAS gene mutations are more common in colorectal villous adenomas and in situ carcinomas than in carcinomas. The study analyzed 134 adenomas, 84 in situ carcinomas, and 171 carcinomas and found that KRAS mutations were present in 61.9% of adenomas, 67.8% of in situ carcinomas, and just 31.6% of carcinomas.

Other genes that have been implicated in this process include BRAF, PIK3CA, and SMAD4. It is important to note that the development and progression of colon cancer is a complex process that involves the accumulation of multiple genetic alterations, and the specific mutations present in any given tumor may vary.",

TP53 or PIK3CA somatic mutations can be found in tumor tissues but not in polyps, and they are potential predictors for malignancy development.

            "The somatic mutations in the APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) gene are commonly associated with the evolution of in situ carcinoma from colonic polyp adenomas. Mutations in the APC gene lead to dysregulation of the Wnt signaling pathway, resulting in uncontrolled cell proliferation and the development of colorectal cancer.",
            "The oncogenes KRAS and BRAF are frequently mutated in colorectal cancer, particularly in serrated lesions that can progress to carcinoma. Somatic mutations in these genes have been associated with the evolution of adenomas into in situ carcinomas. For example, activating mutations in KRAS (e.g., G12D) are common early events in colorectal tumorigenesis and may drive the growth of adenomatous polyps. Subsequent acquisition of additional genetic alterations, including those affecting TP53 or APC genes, can lead to further progression towards invasive carcinoma. BRAF mutations (e.g., V600E) are often found in serrated lesions and have been linked to the development of CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP)-positive tumors, which are characterized by widespread promoter hypermethylation and a high rate of microsatellite instability (MS",

Studies have shown that KRAS mutations are present in a significant proportion of adenomas, particularly those with dysplasia, and are associated with progression to in situ carcinoma. BRAF mutations have also been detected in a subset of serrated polyps, which can progress to in situ carcinoma. The presence of these oncogene mutations suggests that they play a role in the evolution of adenomas to in situ carcinoma, although the exact mechanisms are not fully understood. Further research is needed to determine the frequency and significance of these mutations in different types of colonic polyps and to explore their potential as markers for early detection and prognosis.",

The results showed that the frequency of pathogenic variants in these genes was high, with APC, KRAS, and TP53 mutations being the most common. Notably, the frequency of KRAS mutation was associated with the presence of villous histology and methylation of the APC promoter. However, no association was found between the presence of any singular mutation and the occurrence of subsequent adenoma or CRC. The study supports the multistep model of gradual accumulation of mutations, especially in driver genes such as APC, TP53, and KRAS, during the evolution of in situ carcinoma from colonic polyp adenomas.",

Ki-ras mutations occur in approximately 50% of colorectal carcinomas and a similar percentage of intermediate to late-stage adenomas. The frequency of Ki-ras mutations increases with adenoma size, villous histology, and high-grade dysplasia, which are features associated with adenoma progression. In contrast, p53 mutations are more often detected in large, late-stage adenomas containing carcinoma, suggesting they occur later in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence.",
            "The most commonly associated oncogene somatic mutations in the evolution of in situ carcinoma from colonic polyp adenomas are mutations in the APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) gene and the KRAS gene. Mutations in the APC gene are early events in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence, leading to dysregulated Wnt signaling and increased cell proliferation. KRAS mutations, on the other hand, occur later in the progression to carcinoma and are associated with increased cell survival and resistance to apoptosis.",
