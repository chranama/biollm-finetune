        "Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), also known as brittle bone disease, is a group of genetic disorders that mainly affect the bones. The autosomal dominant form of the disease is cause by a mutation in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes which produce type I collagen.",
        "steogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a heterogeneous bone disorder characterized by recurrent fractures. Although most cases of OI have heterozygous mutations inCOL1A1orCOL1A2and show autosomal dominant inheritance,"

        "Resveratrol (RSV) inhibits leucine-stimulated mTORC1 activation by promoting mTOR/DEPTOR.",
        "Resveratrol downregulates PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathways in human cells. It has been found that resveratrol targets multiple components of the phosphatidylinositol 3- kinase(PI3K)/Akt and mTOR signaling pathways, including PI3K, Akt, PTEN, and DEPTOR, suggesting that this natural compound and its derivatives may offer a promising new cancer treatment."
