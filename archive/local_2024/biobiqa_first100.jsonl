LTP induction resulted in a sequence of morphological changes consisting of a transient remodelling of the postsynaptic membrane followed by a marked increase in the proportion of axon terminals contacting two or more dendritic spines. Three-dimensional reconstruction revealed that these spines arose from the same dendrite.

Under conditions of reduced neuronal activity (1 muM tetrodotoxin), we observed extension of glutamate receptor-dependent processes from dendritic spines of CA1 pyramidal cells to presynaptic boutons. The formation of these spine head protrusions is blocked by alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonists and by agents that reduce the release of glutamate from presynaptic terminals. Moreover, spine head protrusions form in response to exogenously applied glutamate, with clear directionality toward the glutamate electrode.

We examine this directly by correlating time-lapse two-photon microscopy of newly formed spines on CA1 pyramidal neurons in organotypic hippocampal slices with electron microscopy. Our results show that, whereas spines that are only a few hours old rarely form synapses, older spines, ranging from 15 to 19 h, consistently have ultrastructural hallmarks typical of synapses.

Indeed, the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) or depression (LTD) is associated with the enlargement or shrinkage of the spine, respectively.

However, whether neighbouring synapses are involved in encoding similar memory and how task-specific cortical networks develop during learning remain elusive. Using transcranial two-photon microscopy, we followed apical dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the motor cortex while mice practised novel forelimb skills. Here we show that a third of new dendritic spines (postsynaptic structures of most excitatory synapses) formed during the acquisition phase of learning emerge in clusters, and that most such clusters are neighbouring spine pairs. These clustered new spines are more likely to persist throughout prolonged learning sessions, and even long after training stops, than non-clustered counterparts. Moreover, formation of new spine clusters requires repetition of the same motor task, and the emergence of succedent new spine(s) accompanies the strengthening of the first new spine in the cluster. We also show that under control conditions new spines appear to avoid existing stable spines, rather than being uniformly added along dendrites. However, succedent new spines in clusters overcome such a spatial constraint and form in close vicinity to neighbouring stable spines.

Strikingly, CA1 spine turnover dynamics differed sharply from those seen previously in the neocortex. Mathematical modelling revealed that the data best matched kinetic models with a single population of spines with a mean lifetime of approximately 1-2 weeks. This implies ∼100% turnover in ∼2-3 times this interval, a near full erasure of the synaptic connectivity pattern. Although N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blockade stabilizes spines in the neocortex, in CA1 it transiently increased the rate of spine loss and thus lowered spine density.

To investigate whether short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) may also serve as initiators for de novo methylation in human cells we have expressed short hairpin RNAs complementary to the CpG island including the promoter and early transcribed regions of the human RASSF1A gene.

The rat INS-1 cell line has been used to gain insight in this area because it secretes insulin in response to glucose concentrations in the physiological range. However, the magnitude of the response is far less than that seen in freshly isolated rat islets. In the current study, we have stably transfected INS-1 cells with a plasmid containing the human proinsulin gene. After antibiotic selection and clonal expansion, 67% of the resultant clones were found to be poorly responsive to glucose in terms of insulin secretion (< or =2-fold stimulation by 15 mmol/l compared with 3 mmol/l glucose), 17% of the clones were moderately responsive (2- to 5-fold stimulation), and 16% were strongly responsive (5- to 13-fold stimulation). The differences in responsiveness could not be ascribed to differences in insulin content. Detailed analysis of one of the strongly responsive lines (832/13) revealed that its potent response to glucose (average of 10-fold) was stable over 66 population doublings (approximately 7.5 months of tissue culture) with half-maximal stimulation at 6 mmol/l glucose. Furthermore, in the presence of 15 mmol/l glucose, insulin secretion was potentiated significantly by 100 pmol/l isobutylmethylxanthine (320%), 1 mmol/l oleate/palmitate (77%), and 50 nmol/l glucagon-like peptide 1 (60%), whereas carbachol had no effect. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was also potentiated by the sulfonylurea tolbutamide (threefold at 3 mmol/l glucose and 50% at 15 mmol/l glucose) and was abolished by diazoxide, which demonstrates the operation of the ATP-sensitive K+ channel (K(ATP)) in 832/13 cells. Moreover, when the K(ATP) channel was bypassed by incubation of cells in depolarizing K+ (35 mmol/l), insulin secretion was more effectively stimulated by glucose in 832/13 cells than in parental INS-1 cells, which demonstrates the presence of a K(ATP) channel-independent pathway of glucose sensing. We conclude that clonal selection of INS-1 cells allows isolation of cell lines that exhibit markedly enhanced and stable responsiveness to glucose and several of its known potentiators. These lines may be attractive new vehicles for studies of beta-cell function.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10868964"}],"documents":["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10868964"],"type":"not_usable","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":""}

Oxygen saturation of blood in sinusoids was decreased in a dose-dependent manner, reaching values around 40% of control with 1,000 pmol/kg endothelin-1. The degree of decrease in oxygen saturation of blood in sinusoids had an excellent correlation with the calculated blood flow in the liver tissue.

This study investigated if one could use a correlation between telomere length and age, to predict the age of an individual from their DNA. Telomere length, in buccal cells, of 167 individuals aged between 1 and 96 years old was measured using real-time quantitative PCR. Telomere length decreased with age (r=-0.185, P<0.05) and the age of an individual could be roughly determined by the following formula: (age=relative telomere length -1.5/-0.005). The regression (R(2)) value between telomere length and age was approximately 0.04, which is too low to be use for forensics. The causes for the presence of large variation in telomere lengths in the population were further investigated. The age prediction accuracies were low even after dividing samples into non-related Caucasians, males and females (5%, 9% and 1%, respectively). Mean telomere lengths of eight age groups representing each decade of life showed non-linear decrease in telomere length with age. There were variations in telomere lengths even among similarly aged individuals aged 26 years old (n=10) and age 54 years old (n=9).

Construction of gland complementary-DNA libraries and phylogenetic analysis of transcripts revealed that nine toxin types are shared between lizards and snakes.

Mutations and epimutations in imprinted genes can give rise to genetic and epigenetic phenotypes, respectively; uniparental disomy and imprinting defects represent epigenetic disease phenotypes. There are also genetic disorders that affect chromatin structure and remodeling. These disorders can affect chromatin in trans or in cis, as well as expression of both imprinted and nonimprinted genes.

Glycerol is known to shift the native protein ensemble to more compact states. Glycerol also inhibits protein aggregation during the refolding of many proteins. However, mechanistic insight into protein stabilization and prevention of protein aggregation by glycerol is still lacking. In this study, we derive mechanisms of glycerol-induced protein stabilization by combining the thermodynamic framework of preferential interactions with molecular-level insight into solvent-protein interactions gained from molecular simulations. Contrary to the common conception that preferential hydration of proteins in polyol/water mixtures is determined by the molecular size of the polyol and the surface area of the protein, we present evidence that preferential hydration of proteins in glycerol/water mixtures mainly originates from electrostatic interactions that induce orientations of glycerol molecules at the protein surface such that glycerol is further excluded. These interactions shift the native protein toward more compact conformations. Moreover, glycerol preferentially interacts with large patches of contiguous hydrophobicity where glycerol acts as an amphiphilic interface between the hydrophobic surface and the polar solvent. Accordingly, we propose that glycerol prevents protein aggregation by inhibiting protein unfolding and by stabilizing aggregation-prone intermediates through preferential interactions with hydrophobic surface regions that favor amphiphilic interface orientations of glycerol. These mechanisms agree well with experimental data available in the literature, and we discuss the extent to which these mechanisms apply to other cosolvents, including polyols, arginine, and urea.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19817484"}],"documents":["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19817484"],"type":"not_usable","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":""}

After controlling for phylogeny using this procedure, the interpretation of many of the correlates changed. For instance, and contrary to previous studies, we found interspecific support for a neurophysiological role for rapid-eye-movement sleep, such as memory consolidation.

This defining feature of slow-wave sleep (SWS) apparently evolved independently in mammals and birds, as reptiles do not exhibit similar EEG activity during sleep. In mammals, the level of slow-wave activity (SWA) (low-frequency spectral power density) during SWS increases and decreases as a function of prior time spent awake and asleep, respectively, and therefore reflects homeostatically regulated sleep processes potentially tied to the function of SWS. Although birds also exhibit SWS, previous sleep deprivation studies in birds did not detect a compensatory increase in SWS-related SWA during recovery, as observed in similarly sleep-deprived mammals. This suggested that, unlike mammalian SWS, avian SWS is not homeostatically regulated, and therefore might serve a different function. However, we recently demonstrated that SWA during SWS increases in pigeons following short-term sleep deprivation. Herein we summarize research on avian sleep homeostasis, and cast our evidence for this phenomenon within the context of theories for the function of SWS in mammals. We propose that the convergent evolution of homeostatically regulated SWS in mammals and birds was directly linked to the convergent evolution of large, heavily interconnected brains capable of performing complex cognitive processes in each group. Specifically, as has been proposed for mammals, the interconnectivity that forms the basis of complex cognition in birds may also instantiate slow, synchronous network oscillations during SWS that in turn maintain interconnectivity and cognition at an optimal level.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18789355"},{"text":"The conservation of sleep across all animal species suggests that sleep serves a vital function.

Mammalian evolution, therefore, must involve mechanisms that tie increasing body and brain size to decreasing sleep requirements. Here I show that daily sleep requirement decreases across mammalian species and in rat postnatal development with a decreasing ratio between cortical neuronal density and surface area, which presumably causes sleep-inducing metabolites to accumulate more slowly in the parenchyma. Because addition of neurons to the non-primate cortex in mammalian evolution decreases this ratio, I propose that increasing numbers of cortical neurons led to decreased sleep requirement in evolution that allowed for more hours of feeding and increased body mass, which would then facilitate further increases in numbers of brain neurons through a larger caloric intake per hour.

About 40 compounds (industrial processes) were found to be either definitely or probably carcinogenic to man, and 130 chemicals have been adequately tested in rodents and most of them also in various short-term assays. For a comparison between the carcinogenicity of a chemical and its behavior in short-term tests, systems were selected that have a value for predicting carcinogenicity. These were divided into mutagenicity in (A) the S. typhimurium/microsome assay, (B) other submammalian systems and (C) cultured mammalian cells; (D) chromosomal abnormalities in mammalian cells; (E) DNA damage and repair; (F) cell transformation (or altered growth properties) in vitro. The following conclusions can be drawn. In the absence of studies in man, long-term animal tests are still today the only ones capable of providing evidence of the carcinogenic effect of a chemical. The development and application of an appropriate combination of short-term tests (despite current limitations) can significantly contribute to the prediction/confirmation of the carcinogenic effects of chemicals in animals/man. Confidence in positive tests results is increased when they are confirmed in multiple short-term tests using nonrepetitive end points and different activation systems.

TRPM5, which is distantly related to TRPM8, is a Ca2+-activated cation channel expressed in taste cells that is essential for sweet, bitter, and umami tastes.

Our analysis suggests that proteins will be unstable in most polar solvents such as ethanol, extremely stable in non-polar solvents such as cyclohexane, and even more stable in a vacuum. Our solubility studies suggest that protein solubility will be markedly lower in polar solvents such as ethanol and that proteins will be essentially insoluble in non-polar solvents such as cyclohexane. For these and other reasons it seems unlikely that the life we know could exist in any solvent system other than water.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15306378"},{"text":"The goal of this review is to examine the effect of salts and organic additives on the solubility of proteins in aqueous mixed solvents.

Most of the experimental and theoretical results correlate the solubility and the osmotic second virial coefficient in the presence of salts. The correlation of the aqueous protein solubility with the osmotic second virial coefficient when the cosolvent is an organic component requires additional research.

The analysis showed a linear correlation between the preferential hydration parameter and the protein-cosolvent KB parameter. The same linear correlation holds even when nonelectrolyte cosolvents, such as polyethelene glycol, have been incorporated.

Recent time-resolved and thermodynamic studies of water molecules in salt solutions, however, demonstrate that bulk water structure is not central to the Hofmeister effect.

The most famous, and at the same time the most controversial, is the classification of cosolutes and ions as structure-breakers (chaotropes) or structure-makers (kosmotropes), and their identification as salting-in and salting-out agents, respectively. In this paper, we present results from molecular dynamics simulations correlating the ion-induced changes of the structural and dynamical properties of water and the ability of these ions to alter the magnitude of the hydrophobic interaction. Although most of the properties of water in the salt solutions change monotonically with the ability of the salt to increase/decrease the hydrophobic interaction, none of them is able to predict the transition from salting-in to salting-out, a prediction that was observed by the preferential binding/exclusion analysis. In addition, we find that the use of the terms, kosmotropes and chaotropes, is very misleading since the so-called kosmotropes can actually reduce the structure of water, whereas, the so-called chaotropes can increase the structure of water. Specifically, we find that the ability of the ions to reduce the hydrophobic interaction (a property attributed to chaotropes), correlates with their ability to increase the structure between the water molecules, including the number and strength of hydrogen bonds, and as a consequence, the water-water interaction energy (features attributed to kosmotropes). Nevertheless, the viscosity (as well as the rotational decay rate) of the water molecules decreases (increases) due to weaker binding to the ions. Thus, it is not the ion-induced structural ordering between the water molecules that affect the dynamical properties of water, but the strength of the ion-water interaction. Our results indicate that attempts to understand and predict salt-induced modulation of hydrophobic interactions only through the binary, salt-water, system is not possible.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19994836"}],"documents":["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15306378","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16814736","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16821951","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17035073","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19994836"],"type":"factoid","exact_answer":"correlated with the preferential binding parameter","ideal_answer":"the aqueous protein solubility is correlated with the preferential binding parameter"}

Deletion of the Dnmt3L gene prevented the de novo methylation of both long-terminal-repeat (LTR) and non-LTR retrotransposons, which were transcribed at high levels in spermatogonia and spermatocytes. Loss of Dnmt3L from early germ cells also caused meiotic failure in spermatocytes, which do not express Dnmt3L. Whereas dispersed repeated sequences were demethylated in mutant germ cells, tandem repeats in pericentric regions were methylated normally. This result indicates that the Dnmt3L protein might have a function in the de novo methylation of dispersed repeated sequences in a premeiotic genome scanning process that occurs in male germ cells at about the time of birth.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15318244"},{"text":"Vertebrate CpG islands (CGIs) are short interspersed DNA sequences that deviate significantly from the average genomic pattern by being GC-rich, CpG-rich, and predominantly nonmethylated.

Shared DNA sequence features adapt CGIs for promoter function by destabilizing nucleosomes and attracting proteins that create a transcriptionally permissive chromatin state.

A human liver cell line (Hep G2) infected with the HDAd-mCMV-Gulo vector expressed GULO in a time- and gene dose-dependent manner. These cells also produced ascorbic acid when exogenous gulonolactone was supplemented in the medium. Likewise, Gulo(-/-) mice treated with HDAd-mCMV-Gulo at 2 x 10(11) VP expressed GULO in the liver and produced ascorbic acid. Serum ascorbic acid concentrations in Gulo(-/-) mice injected with GULO-expressing HDAd were elevated to levels comparable to those of wild-type mice (62 +/- 15 microM) after 4 days of infection and were maintained at significantly higher levels compared with those in untreated Gulo(-/-) mice for at least 23 days. A similar elevation was observed in urine and tissue ascorbic acid concentrations in vector-treated animals. In conclusion, we demonstrate here that gene therapeutic HDAd-mCMV-Gulo vectors can mediate the expression of GULO and endogenous production of ascorbic acid in human cells and in Gulo(-/-) transgenic mice.

As a result, we found that there was a significant fluctuation in the modifications; in spermatogonia, the stainings for H3K9ac, H3K18ac, and H3K23ac were strong while that for H3K4me3 was weak. In spermatocytes, the stainings for H3K9ac, H3K18ac, H3K23ac, and H3K4me3 were reduced in the preleptotene to pachytene stage, but in diplotene stage the stainings for H3K18ac, H3K23ac, and H3K4me3 seemed to become intense again. The staining for H3K27me3 was nearly constant throughout these stages. In the ensuing spermiogenesis, a dramatic acetylation and methylation of histone H3 was found in the early elongated spermatids and then almost all signals disappeared in the late elongated spermatids, in parallel with the replacement from histones to protamines. In addition, we confirmed that the staining of histone H3S10phos was exclusively associated with mitotic and meiotic cell division.

Signaling sequences and sites of posttranslational modifications are frequently, or very likely most often, located within regions of intrinsic disorder. Disorder-to-order transitions are coupled with the adoption of different structures with different partners. Also, the flexibility of intrinsic disorder helps different disordered regions to bind to a common binding site on a common partner. Such capacity for binding diversity plays important roles in both protein-protein interaction networks and likely also in gene regulation networks. Such disorder-based signaling is further modulated in multicellular eukaryotes by alternative splicing, for which such splicing events map to regions of disorder much more often than to regions of structure. Associating alternative splicing with disorder rather than structure alleviates theoretical and experimentally observed problems associated with the folding of different length, isomeric amino acid sequences. The combination of disorder and alternative splicing is proposed to provide a mechanism for easily \"trying out\" different signaling pathways, thereby providing the mechanism for generating signaling diversity and enabling the evolution of cell differentiation and multicellularity. Finally, several recent small molecules of interest as potential drugs have been shown to act by blocking protein-protein interactions based on intrinsic disorder of one of the partners.

To clarify the mechanism of photon emission, intensity changes from whole brain slices were examined under various conditions. The removal of glucose from the incubation medium suppressed the photon emission, and adding 50 mM potassium ions led to temporal enhancement of emission and subsequent depression. Rotenone (20 microM), an inhibitor of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, increased photon emission, indicating electron leakage from the respiratory chain. These results suggest that the photon emission from the brain slices originates from the energy metabolism of the inner mitochondrial respiratory chain through the production of reactive oxygen.

Some of the color-selective cells in the blobs exhibited receptive fields that were similar to those found in the parvocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN): one type exhibited center-surround spatial and chromatic opponency corresponding to the Type I cell found in the LGN; another had center-only chromatic opponency, corresponding to the Type II cell of the LGN. A blob color-selective cell with no LGN counterpart had center color opponency with a nonchromatically opponent surround antagonism. We termed this cell the \"modified Type II\" cell.

Some blob cells previously characterized as double opponent probably belong to our modified Type II category and, unlike true double opponent cells, do not respond well to isoluminant color boundaries. Occasional color-selective oriented cells were either intermixed or in close proximity to blob cells. Neighboring electrode penetrations within the same blob yielded cells of the same color opponency, either red versus green or blue versus yellow, suggesting that individual blobs are dedicated to processing one color opponency.

One explanation for this effect is that it results from a disturbance of competitive process which, during the first weeks of life, guides a \"sorting out\" of the initially intermixed right and left eye inputs into complementary, largely non-overlapping territories. One feature of this process may be a local interaction between right and left eye synapses in which like synapses reinforce each other's growth rates and cause rejection of the other eye's synapses. If this is the case, then the effect of monocular deprivation on the relative sizes of the two sets of columns can be explained by supposing that the strengths of the effects exerted by the deprived eye are reduced. This explanation has a testable consequence: if both eyes are deprived of vision then each eye should be made less effective in eliminating the other eye's inputs, and the overall rate at which the ocular dominance columns form should be decreased. Although LeVay et al. found that columns were present in a 7-week old monkey reared in the dark from the age of 3 days, this result does not necessarily imply that the rate of column formation had been normal, because in normal monkeys the columns are well developed by 3 or more weeks of age.

The effects of the two psychostimulants, cocaine and d-amphetamine, were studied on acetylcholine release in the hippocampus and compared to effects observed in the caudate nucleus. Administration of cocaine (10 and 20 mg/kg i.p.) increased acetylcholine release by 130 and 190% in the hippocampus, whereas in the caudate nucleus the enhancement was 51 and 80% over basal values, respectively. After the injection of d-amphetamine (1 and 2 mg/kg i.p.) the enhancement of acetylcholine release was 110 and 210% in the hippocampus whereas it was 35 and 54%, respectively, in the caudate nucleus. As observed in the caudate nucleus, pretreatment with the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist, SCH 23390, antagonized the cocaine- and amphetamine-induced increase in hippocampal acetylcholine release. These results show that cocaine and d-amphetamine, by increasing dopaminergic transmission, enhance the extracellular concentrations of acetylcholine in both brain areas. The relative enhancement in the hippocampus was far greater than that in the caudate nucleus, suggesting that dopaminergic control of cholinergic function differs in these two brain areas.

During a 15-min exposure to amphetamine (50 microM) in the nucleus accumbens, acetylcholine increased to 33% above pre-infusion levels, became maximal at 15 min post-infusion (+41%) and gradually returned to baseline levels by 60 min post-amphetamine. Conversely, amphetamine (1 mM) administration caused a biphasic change in acetylcholine release with a trend toward a decrease (-14%) during exposure followed by a significant increase (+36%) at 30 min post-amphetamine that returned to baseline levels by 60 min after infusion. The increases observed during amphetamine (50 microM) exposure and during recovery from amphetamine (1 mM) were both blocked by co-administration with the D1 antagonist, SCH 23390 (10 microM), but not with the D2 antagonist, sulpiride (10 microM). Co-infusion of sulpiride eliminated the trend toward reduced acetylcholine release observed during 1 mM amphetamine whereas co-administration of SCH 23390 potentiated this decrease. A possible tonic D1 facilitation of nucleus accumbens acetylcholine release was indicated by the consistent reductions in acetylcholine release observed during infusion of SCH 23390. These results suggest that amphetamine administration in the nucleus accumbens induces a bidirectional change in acetylcholine release that is dependent on dose and opposing effects of nucleus accumbens D1 and D2 activation.

Escherichia coli strains harboring a recombinant plasmid, pCJP3, which contains this 4-kb fragment, excreted IAA into culture media, and crude cell extracts had both tryptophan monooxygenase and indoleacetamide hydrolase activity. In vitro coupled transcription-translation of pCJP3 demonstrated that this fragment coded for proteins of 62 and 47 kilodaltons which correspond to tryptophan monooxygenase and indoleacetamide hydrolase, respectively.

Here we argue that the recent development of transgenic molecular devices will encourage a shift from mechanistic investigations of synaptic plasticity in single neurons towards an analysis of how networks of neurons encode and represent memory, and we suggest ways in which this might be achieved.

Here, rather than focusing on a single name, we take a general approach by seeking evidence for a link in a sample of 150 randomly ascertained pairs of males who each share a British surname. We show that sharing a surname significantly elevates the probability of sharing a Y-chromosomal haplotype and that this probability increases as surname frequency decreases.

The reduction of complexity greatly simplifies genetics and genomics in plant species with large genomes. However, as flow cytometry requires liquid suspensions of particles, the lack of suitable protocols for preparation of solutions of intact chromosomes delayed the application of flow cytogenetics in plants. This chapter outlines a high-yielding procedure for preparation of solutions of intact mitotic chromosomes from root tips of young seedlings and for their analysis using flow cytometry and sorting. Root tips accumulated at metaphase are mildly fixed with formaldehyde, and solutions of intact chromosomes are prepared by mechanical homogenization. The advantages of the present approach include the use of seedlings, which are easy to handle, and the karyological stability of root meristems, which can be induced to high degree of metaphase synchrony. Chromosomes isolated according to this protocol have well-preserved morphology, withstand shearing forces during sorting, and their DNA is intact and suitable for a range of applications.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21181533"}],"documents":["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21181533"],"type":"not_usable","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":""}

We demonstrate here that SA-beta-gal activity is expressed from GLB1, the gene encoding lysosomal beta-D-galactosidase, the activity of which is typically measured at acidic pH 4.5. Fibroblasts from patients with autosomal recessive G(M1)-gangliosidosis, which have defective lysosomal beta-galactosidase, did not express SA-beta-gal at late passages even though they underwent replicative senescence. In addition, late passage normal fibroblasts expressing small-hairpin interfering RNA that depleted GLB1 mRNA underwent senescence but failed to express SA-beta-gal. GLB1 mRNA depletion also prevented expression of SA-beta-gal activity in HeLa cervical carcinoma cells induced to enter a senescent state by repression of their endogenous human papillomavirus E7 oncogene. SA-beta-gal induction during senescence was due at least in part to increased expression of the lysosomal beta-galactosidase protein.

Twelve initially identical populations of Escherichia coli were founded in 1988 to investigate this issue. They have since evolved in a glucose-limited medium that also contains citrate, which E. coli cannot use as a carbon source under oxic conditions. No population evolved the capacity to exploit citrate for >30,000 generations, although each population tested billions of mutations. A citrate-using (Cit+) variant finally evolved in one population by 31,500 generations, causing an increase in population size and diversity. The long-delayed and unique evolution of this function might indicate the involvement of some extremely rare mutation. Alternately, it may involve an ordinary mutation, but one whose physical occurrence or phenotypic expression is contingent on prior mutations in that population. We tested these hypotheses in experiments that \"replayed\" evolution from different points in that population's history. We observed no Cit+ mutants among 8.4 x 10(12) ancestral cells, nor among 9 x 10(12) cells from 60 clones sampled in the first 15,000 generations. However, we observed a significantly greater tendency for later clones to evolve Cit+, indicating that some potentiating mutation arose by 20,000 generations. This potentiating change increased the mutation rate to Cit+ but did not cause generalized hypermutability. Thus, the evolution of this phenotype was contingent on the particular history of that population. More generally, we suggest that historical contingency is especially important when it facilitates the evolution of key innovations that are not easily evolved by gradual, cumulative selection.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18524956"}],"documents":["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18524956"],"type":"not_usable","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":""}

In this review, we summarize half a century of research and come to the disappointing realization that the column may have no function. Originally, it was described as a discrete structure, spanning the layers of the somatosensory cortex, which contains cells responsive to only a single modality, such as deep joint receptors or cutaneous receptors. Subsequently, examples of columns have been uncovered in numerous cortical areas, expanding the original concept to embrace a variety of different structures and principles. A \"column\" now refers to cells in any vertical cluster that share the same tuning for any given receptive field attribute. In striate cortex, for example, cells with the same eye preference are grouped into ocular dominance columns. Unaccountably, ocular dominance columns are present in some species, but not others. In principle, it should be possible to determine their function by searching for species differences in visual performance that correlate with their presence or absence. Unfortunately, this approach has been to no avail; no visual faculty has emerged that appears to require ocular dominance columns. Moreover, recent evidence has shown that the expression of ocular dominance columns can be highly variable among members of the same species, or even in different portions of the visual cortex in the same individual. These observations deal a fatal blow to the idea that ocular dominance columns serve a purpose. More broadly, the term \"column\" also denotes the periodic termination of anatomical projections within or between cortical areas. In many instances, periodic projections have a consistent relationship with some architectural feature, such as the cytochrome oxidase patches in V1 or the stripes in V2. These tissue compartments appear to divide cells with different receptive field properties into distinct processing streams. However, it is unclear what advantage, if any, is conveyed by this form of columnar segregation. Although the column is an attractive concept, it has failed as a unifying principle for understanding cortical function. Unravelling the organization of the cerebral cortex will require a painstaking description of the circuits, projections and response properties peculiar to cells in each of its various areas.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15937015"}],"documents":["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15937015"],"type":"not_usable","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":""}

Elevated hydrostatic pressures extend the temperature maximum for possible cell proliferation from 116 degrees C at 0.4 MPa to 122 degrees C at 20 MPa, providing the potential for growth even at 122 degrees C under an in situ high pressure. In addition, piezophilic growth significantly affected stable carbon isotope fractionation of methanogenesis from CO(2). Under conventional growth conditions, the isotope fractionation of methanogenesis by M. kandleri strain 116 was similar to values (-34 per thousand to -27 per thousand) previously reported for other hydrogenotrophic methanogens. However, under high hydrostatic pressures, the isotope fractionation effect became much smaller (< -12 per thousand), and the kinetic isotope effect at 122 degrees C and 40 MPa was -9.4 per thousand, which is one of the smallest effects ever reported. This observation will shed light on the sources and production mechanisms of deep-sea methane.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18664583"}],"documents":["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18664583"],"type":"not_usable","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":""}

{"body":"Questions to ask to a panel of people that will be sequenced","snippets":[{"text":"Dancing, which is integrally related to music, likely has its origins close to the birth of Homo sapiens, and throughout our history, dancing has been universally practiced in all societies. We hypothesized that there are differences among individuals in aptitude, propensity, and need for dancing that may partially be based on differences in common genetic polymorphisms. Identifying such differences may lead to an understanding of the neurobiological basis of one of mankind's most universal and appealing behavioral traits--dancing. In the current study, 85 current performing dancers and their parents were genotyped for the serotonin transporter (SLC6A4: promoter region HTTLPR and intron 2 VNTR) and the arginine vasopressin receptor 1a (AVPR1a: promoter microsatellites RS1 and RS3). We also genotyped 91 competitive athletes and a group of nondancers/nonathletes (n = 872 subjects from 414 families). Dancers scored higher on the Tellegen Absorption Scale, a questionnaire that correlates positively with spirituality and altered states of consciousness, as well as the Reward Dependence factor in Cloninger's Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire, a measure of need for social contact and openness to communication. Highly significant differences in AVPR1a haplotype frequencies (RS1 and RS3), especially when conditional on both SLC6A4 polymorphisms (HTTLPR and VNTR), were observed between dancers and athletes using the UNPHASED program package (Cocaphase: likelihood ratio test [LRS] = 89.23, p = 0.000044). Similar results were obtained when dancers were compared to nondancers/nonathletes (Cocaphase: LRS = 92.76, p = 0.000024). These results were confirmed using a robust family-based test (Tdtphase: LRS = 46.64, p = 0.010). Association was also observed between Tellegen Absorption Scale scores and AVPR1a (Qtdtphase: global chi-square = 26.53, p = 0.047), SLC6A4 haplotypes (Qtdtphase: chi-square = 2.363, p = 0.018), and AVPR1a conditional on SCL6A4 (Tdtphase: LRS = 250.44, p = 0.011). Similarly, significant association was observed between Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire Reward Dependence scores and AVPR1a RS1 (chi-square = 20.16, p = 0.01). Two-locus analysis (RS1 and RS3 conditional on HTTLPR and VNTR) was highly significant (LRS = 162.95, p = 0.001). Promoter repeat regions in the AVPR1a gene have been robustly demonstrated to play a role in molding a range of social behaviors in many vertebrates and, more recently, in humans. Additionally, serotonergic neurotransmission in some human studies appears to mediate human religious and spiritual experiences. We therefore hypothesize that the association between AVPR1a and SLC6A4 reflects the social communication, courtship, and spiritual facets of the dancing phenotype rather than other aspects of this complex phenotype, such as sensorimotor integration.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16205790"}],"documents":["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16205790"],"type":"not_usable","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":""}
{"body":"How crowded is the bacterial cell?","snippets":[{"text":"The very high concentration of macromolecules within cells can potentially have an overwhelming effect on the thermodynamic activity of cellular components because of excluded volume effects. To estimate the magnitudes of such effects, we have made an experimental study of the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli. Parameters from cells and cell extracts are used to calculate approximate activity coefficients for cytoplasmic conditions. These calculations require a representation of the sizes, concentrations and effective specific volumes of the macromolecules in the extracts. Macromolecule size representations are obtained either by applying a two-phase distribution assay to define a related homogeneous solution or by using the molecular mass distribution of macromolecules from gel filtration. Macromolecule concentrations in cytoplasm are obtained from analyses of extracts by applying a correction for the dilution that occurs during extraction. That factor is determined from experiments based upon the known impermeability of the cytoplasmic volume to sucrose in intact E. coli. Macromolecule concentrations in the cytoplasm of E. coli in either exponential or stationary growth phase are estimated to be approximately 0.3 to 0.4 g/ml. Macromolecule specific volumes are inferred from the composition of close-packed precipitates induced by polyethylene glycol. Several well-characterized proteins which bind to DNA (lac repressor, RNA polymerase) are extremely sensitive to changes in salt concentration in studies in vitro, but are insensitive in studies in vivo. Application of the activity coefficients from the present work indicates that at least part of this discrepancy arises from the difference in excluded volumes in these studies. Applications of the activity coefficients to solubility or to association reactions are also discussed, as are changes associated with cell growth phase and osmotic or other effects. The use of solutions of purified macromolecules that emulate the crowding conditions inferred for cytoplasm is discussed.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1748995"},{"text":"Enzyme kinetic parameters for rate equations are vital in metabolic network simulation, a major part of systems biology research efforts.

An increase in Kcat was observed at very low concentrations of crowding agent, and also at high crowder concentrations when the experiment was performed at 45 °C with PEG. The observed pattern in Kcat for G6P DH at high crowder concentrations has been explained via modelling using excluded volume theory.

These proteins also exhibit appreciable affinity for nonspecific DNA, and thus this apparently facilitated binding rate must be interpreted in terms of a two-step binding mechanism. The first step involves free diffusion to any nonspecific binding site on the DNA, and the second step comprises a series of protein translocation events that are also driven by thermal fluctuations. Because of nonspecific binding, the search process in the second step is of reduced dimensionality (or volume); this results in an accelerated apparent rate of target location. In this paper we define four types of processes that may be involved in these protein translocation events between DNA sites. These are (i) \"macroscopic\" dissociation--reassociation processes within the domain of the DNA molecule, (ii) \"microscopic\" dissociation--reassociation events between closely spaced sites in the DNA molecule, (iii) \"intersegment transfer\" (via \"ring-closure\") processes between different segments of the DNA molecule, and (iv) \"sliding\" along the DNA molecule. We present mathematical and physical descriptions of each of these processes, and the consequences of each for the overall rate of target location are worked out as a function of both the nonspecific binding affinity between protein and DNA and the length of the DNA molecule containing the target sequence. The theory is developed in terms of the Escherichia coli lac repressor--operator interaction since data for testing these approaches are available for this system [Barkley, M.

Such uniqueness was seemingly necessary to justify the superior cognitive abilities of humans over larger-brained mammals such as elephants and whales. However, our recent studies using a novel method to determine the cellular composition of the brain of humans and other primates as well as of rodents and insectivores show that, since different cellular scaling rules apply to the brains within these orders, brain size can no longer be considered a proxy for the number of neurons in the brain. These studies also showed that the human brain is not exceptional in its cellular composition, as it was found to contain as many neuronal and non-neuronal cells as would be expected of a primate brain of its size. Additionally, the so-called overdeveloped human cerebral cortex holds only 19% of all brain neurons, a fraction that is similar to that found in other mammals. In what regards absolute numbers of neurons, however, the human brain does have two advantages compared to other mammalian brains: compared to rodents, and probably to whales and elephants as well, it is built according to the very economical, space-saving scaling rules that apply to other primates; and, among economically built primate brains, it is the largest, hence containing the most neurons. These findings argue in favor of a view of cognitive abilities that is centered on absolute numbers of neurons, rather than on body size or encephalization, and call for a re-examination of several concepts related to the exceptionality of the human brain.","beginSection":"abstract","endSection":"abstract","document":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19915731"}],"documents":["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19915731"],"type":"not_usable","exact_answer":"","ideal_answer":""}
