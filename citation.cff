  This repository accompanies the Master's thesis *LLM Fine-Tuning With Biomedical Open-Source Data*,
  developed at the Faculty of Science of the University of Lisbon. It provides an end-to-end
  fine-tuning and evaluation pipeline for biomedical question answering using open-weight large
  language models (LLMs) such as Mistral and TinyLlama, with support for LoRA/QLoRA, reproducible
  training configurations, and modular evaluation utilities.
