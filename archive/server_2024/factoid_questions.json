            "The fastest infusion time for oxaliplatin is 30 minutes, as mentioned in the articles. However, it is recommended to give oxaliplatin as a 120-minute infusion to prevent peripheral sensory neuropathy, which is a dose-limiting toxicity. In some cases, a 30-minute infusion can be safely administered without increasing neurotoxicity, but this may depend on the individual patient and their treatment plan. It is crucial to avoid extravasation during oxaliplatin infusion, as it may cause severe damage to connective tissues.",
            "Summary: The fastest oxaliplatin infusion time is 30 minutes, according to a phase II trial with capecitabine (XELOX30) as second-line therapy in patients with advanced colorectal cancer resistant to irinotecan. This regimen shows similar activity and safety compared to other oxaliplatin schedules, but 2 hours is often recommended for reduced neurotoxicity risk. Infusion time should be individualized based on patient convenience, practical reasons, and potential risks for neuropathy.",
            "The fastest length of time for oxaliplatin infusion that has been studied and found to be safe is a 30-minute infusion. This was observed in a phase II study of XELOX30 (capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 orally twice daily on days 1-14 and oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 as a 30 min infusion on day 1) in patients with advanced colorectal cancer resistant to irinotecan. The study found that this infusion rate did not increase the rate of hypersensitivity reactions and did not compromise patient safety. This infusion rate is safe for use in routine practice.",
            "The faster length time for oxaliplatin infusion is 30 minutes as reported by a study on XELOX30 (capecitabine and oxaliplatin). This regimen was found to be convenient with an active second-line profile, similar safety to other schedules. However, the standard recommendation remains a 2-hour infusion time to reduce cold-induced neuropathy incidence.",
            "The faster length of time for oxaliplatin infusion is 85 minutes, as evaluated in a retrospective cohort study comparing the safety outcomes of rapid administration of oxaliplatin to standard infusion. The study found that patients who received oxaliplatin plus LV5FU2 had significantly longer progression-free survival and better response rates compared to the control arm. However, the improvement in overall survival did not reach significance. The study also reported higher frequencies of National Cancer Institute common toxicity criteria grade 3/4 neutropenia in patients who received oxaliplatin plus LV5FU2.",
            "The fastest length of time for oxaliplatin infusion is 30 minutes. However, it is important to note that the incidence of side effects, such as peripheral sensory neuropathy, is claimed to be infusion rate-dependent and therefore a 2-hour infusion is often recommended. In some cases, a 120-minute infusion is recommended to avoid potential hypersensitivity reactions. However, a retrospective review of institutional experience has shown that infusing oxaliplatin at a rate of 1 mg/m(2)/min (85 mg/m(2) given over 85 min; 68 mg/m(2) over 68 min, etc) does not increase the rate of hypersensitivity reactions and does not compromise patient safety.",
            "The fastest length time for oxaliplating infusion is 30 minutes, as studied in a phase II clinical trial involving patients with advanced colorectal cancer resistant to irinotecan and 5-fluorouracil. The trial found that XELOX (capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 orally twice daily on days 1-14 and oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 as a 30 min infusion on day 1) was an active and convenient second-line regimen with a safety profile similar to that of other oxaliplatin schedules. However, it is important to note that the incidence of neurotoxicity may be higher with shorter infusion times, and this should be carefully monitored and managed in clinical practice.",
            "Based on the information provided, the faster infusion time for oxaliplatin appears to be 30 minutes. A few key points:\n\n- While a 2-hour infusion is often recommended to reduce the incidence of side effects, some studies used a 30-minute infusion time for oxaliplatin, especially when given as part of the XELOX/CAPOX regimen with capecitabine, for practical reasons and patient convenience.\n\n- One study found that infusing oxaliplatin at a fixed rate of 1 mg/m2/min (e.g. 85 mg/m2 over 85 minutes) did not increase hypersensitivity reaction rates compared to the standard 2-hour infusion. \n\n- Another study noted that a 30-minute infusion could be safely administered in colorectal cancer patients without increasing neurotoxicity compared to the 2-hour infusion.\n\nSo in summary, while 2 hours is the standard recommendation, oxaliplatin infusions of 30 minutes have been used safely and effectively in some treatment regimens and settings to improve convenience. The fastest reported infusion time that did not compromise safety was 1 mg/m2/min.",
            "Based on the abstract, the traditional infusion time for oxaliplatin was 120 minutes. However, with the new policy of infusing oxaliplatin at a rate of 1 mg/m\u00b2/min, the infusion time is significantly reduced. For example, an 85 mg/m\u00b2 dose can be infused in 85 minutes, and a 68 mg/m\u00b2 dose can be infused in 68 minutes. Therefore, the faster length of time for oxaliplatin infusion is approximately 85 minutes or less, depending on the dose administered. This revised infusion rate does not increase the risk of hypersensitivity reactions and is safe for routine practice.",

            "Colonoscopy every 10 years is the most cost-effective primary screening strategy for colorectal cancer in the general population, according to a decision tree modeling study. The study compared five common and effective CRC screening modalities in average-risk 40-year olds versus deferring screening until 50 (standard of care) under a limited societal perspective. Flexible sigmoidoscopy, FOBT, and FIT all dominated the current standard of care, while colonoscopy and FIT-DNA were cost-effective. Regardless of screening modality, CRC screening at 40 years old is cost-effective with increased QALYs compared to current screening initiation at 50 years old, with flexible sigmoidoscopy being the most preferred option. Therefore, consideration should be given for a general recommendation to start screening at age 40 for average risk individuals.",

However, several studies suggest that flexible sigmoidoscopy, fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), and fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) are cost-effective screening options. In particular, flexible sigmoidoscopy has been found to be the most favorable intervention by net monetary benefit in some studies. It is important to note that the cost-effectiveness of a screening strategy can vary depending on the context-specific parameters and the framework of the cost-effectiveness analysis. Therefore, it is recommended to adopt a reference-based methodology for economic evaluation studies to make the results more comparable.",

The most cost-effective method is likely to be a combination of screening tests, such as fecal occult blood test (FOBT) and flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS). These tests have been shown to be effective in reducing colorectal cancer incidence and mortality, and they are relatively inexpensive compared to other screening methods. Additionally, risk-stratification based on genetic and phenotypic factors can help identify individuals who are at high risk for colorectal cancer and target screening efforts accordingly. Overall, colorectal cancer screening is a valuable investment in public health, as it can save lives and reduce healthcare costs in the long run.",

However, several studies suggest that some screening methods are more cost-effective than others. Fecal immunochemical tests (FIT) and colonoscopy are frequently reported as cost-effective options. For instance, in a systematic review, CRC screening with colonoscopy and FIT was found to be cost-effective compared to no screening. Another study found that, under the assumption of perfect adherence, annual mSEPT9 screening resulted in more quality-adjusted life-years gained and averted more CRC cases and deaths than annual FIT screening, but it led to a higher rate of colonoscopy referrals. Ultimately, the choice of the most cost-effective CRC screening strategy should consider factors such as effectiveness, harms, cost, screening interval, patient preferences, and test availability.",

However, if compliance rates are low, annual fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) becomes a more cost-effective option. Flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 or 10 years is less cost-effective than the other two screening methods. These conclusions are based on computer models of a Markov process that compare the cost-effectiveness of fecal occult blood testing, flexible sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy by using U.S. vital statistics, cancer statistics, published data on the sensitivity, specificity, and efficacy of various screening techniques, and Medicare reimbursement data for costs.",

The summary states that modeling studies suggest fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) every 1-2 years, sigmoidoscopy every 5 years with FOBT every 2-3 years, and colonoscopy every 10 years are all considered cost-effective compared to no screening. However, the additional evidence specifically highlights that colonoscopy was found to be cost-effective compared to no screening and even compared to FIT (fecal immunochemical testing, a type of FOBT), with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $28,071 per life-year gained.

Furthermore, integrating morphology and time-based analysis alongside standard CTC enumeration can provide greater insight into the pathophysiology of mCRC by highlighting the complexity of the disease across a patient's treatment.

It has been shown to be highly predictive of early disease recurrence in surgically resected colorectal cancer, and is superior to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in detecting residual disease and early recurrence. Additionally, pre-surgery ctDNA levels are positively correlated with tumor burden and have predictive value for relapse. Positive ctDNA has been found to precede radiologic and clinical evidence of recurrence by a median of 3 months. Furthermore, in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), detection of ctDNA following curative intent therapies is a surrogate for microscopic residual disease.",

However, when comparing their performance after complete resection of CRC metastases, it is essential to consider the specific clinical context and purpose of the liquid biopsy. , For detecting residual or recurrent disease, CTCs seem to be the most reliable technique among those studied, as they showed the best diagnostic performance with a pooled sensitivity of 0.82 (95% CI 0.79-0.85) and specificity of 0.97 (95% CI 0.95-0.99).

This method has been validated and approved by the FDA as a useful prognostic method for metastatic breast, colon, and prostate cancer. However, it is important to note that detecting ctDNA in blood samples can be challenging due to the presence of wild type DNA from white blood cells, and pre-analytical considerations such as preventing or delaying white cell lysis, using cell stabilization tubes, and performing a double centrifugation step can help improve ctDNA detection. Plasma is better than serum for ctDNA recovery, and ctDNA or cfDNA can be extracted from plasma fractions using commercially available kits. The analysis of ctDNA after extraction requires the use of various amplification and sequencing methods, which can be separated into two main groups: untargeted approaches (e.g., whole genome or whole exome sequencing) and targeted approaches (e.g., sequencing of ctDNA based on mutational hotspots for the cancer of interest). Targeted approaches can amplify ctDNA through polymerase chain reactions (PCR) or digital PCR, which is especially important given the low levels of DNA circulating in the bloodstream and the small proportion of ctDNA in the total cell-free DNA extracted.",

This was found in a study that analyzed data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Registry (SEER) of individuals aged 45-79 years from 2000-2017. The results showed that while the incidence of colorectal cancer decreased for both males and females during the study period, African Americans had the least decline in incidence. Moreover, African American females had the highest risk for colorectal cancer compared to other females or males from different racial groups, and they also had the poorest 5-year survival rate among females. This highlights the need for targeted interventions and screening strategies to reduce the burden of colorectal cancer in this population.",

This is supported by multiple studies and sources, including a 2016 report stating that CRC incidence was higher among Blacks (42.5 per 100,000) than Whites (38.0), Latinos (31.7) and Asians (30.0). Additionally, a 2012 study found that after a mean follow-up of 10.8 years, CRC incidence was the highest in African-Americans (annualized rate = 0.14%) compared to Whites, Native Americans, Asian/Pacific Islanders, and Hispanics. A 2021 study also found that Black Americans have a higher risk of CRC incidence and mortality compared to other groups.",
