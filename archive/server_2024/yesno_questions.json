            "It is generally assumed that there is a clear distinction between promoters, which initiate transcription, and enhancers, which control the spatiotemporal expression. However, studies have unexpectedly shown that regulatory elements can have both enhancer and promoter functions.\nFor example, some enhancers (mainly bidirectional) can act as weak promoters, producing overlapping spatiotemporal expression. Conversely, bidirectional promoters often act as strong enhancers, while unidirectional promoters generally cannot.",
            "Enhancers and promoters are cis-regulatory elements in the genome that regulate target gene transcription. While traditionally considered distinct, recent evidence suggests that there is overlap between their functions. Some enhancers, particularly bidirectional ones, can act as weak promoters, producing overlapping spatio-temporal expression. Conversely, some promoters, especially bidirectional ones, can function as strong enhancers. The balance between enhancer and promoter activity is reflected in the levels and directionality of enhancer RNA (eRNA) transcription, which is likely an inherent sequence property of the elements themselves. These observations suggest that enhancers and promoters may lie on a spectrum of transcriptional regulation, rather than being strictly separate entities. However, more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms and implications of this relationship.",
            "While enhancers and promoters have distinct canonical functions, there is evidence that enhancers can sometimes act as weak promoters in addition to their primary role of augmenting transcription from target promoters:\n\n- Some enhancers are transcribed, producing enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), before activating their target promoter. This suggests enhancers can directly recruit transcriptional machinery.\n\n- Certain DNA elements have been found to possess both enhancer and promoter activity, blurring the line between the two.\n\n- Enhancers and promoters share some features like transcription factor binding, open chromatin, and transcriptional activity.\n\nSo while enhancers mainly serve to boost transcription from promoters, they can occasionally act as weak promoters themselves. The boundary between enhancers and promoters is not always clear cut, with some overlap in their functions and characteristics. However, their primary roles remain distinct, with promoters directly initiating transcription and enhancers mainly augmenting promoter activity."

However, the cost-effectiveness of CTC depends more on the prevalence of advanced adenomas or the transition rate to colorectal cancer than on CTC accuracy or screening compliance. The potential disadvantage of radiation exposure with CTC is probably overemphasized, especially with newer technology.

            "While many studies consider DNA sequences of CRISPR target sites as the primary determinant for CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis efficiency and mutation profiles, increasing evidence reveals the substantial role of chromatin context. Indeed, results across different organisms have shown that Cas9-mediated editing is more efficient in open chromatin regions (euchromatin) than in closed ones (heterochromatin).",
            "Yes, chromatin accessibility significantly affects CRISPR-Cas9 efficiency. The abstracts collectively demonstrate that gene editing is more efficient in euchromatin (open chromatin) than in heterochromatin (closed chromatin). This correlation is observed in various cell lines and organisms, including HEK293T cells, HeLa cells, human fibroblasts, and zebrafish embryos. The studies show that chromatin openness positively correlates with CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis efficiency, whereas closed chromatin regions exhibit reduced editing efficiency. These findings are consistent across different experimental settings, including in vitro and in vivo systems. Furthermore, modulating chromatin accessibility using transactivation or targeting proximal dsgRNAs can enhance Cas9 editing efficiency in vivo. Therefore, considering chromatin accessibility is crucial for optimizing CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing outcomes."

            "Answer A: Based on the given information, it is not suggested to use PET-CT as a routine test in initial evaluation of locally advanced rectal cancer patients, as the study is focused on evaluating the effectiveness of PET-CT scan in predicting tumour regression grade (TRG) after chemoradiotherapy (CRT). \n\nAnswer B: Further research is needed to determine the usefulness of PET-CT in initial evaluation of locally advanced rectal cancer patients.",
            "The current international guidelines do not recommend routine PET-CT scan during the initial evaluation of locally advanced rectal cancer patients. Nevertheless, recent research indicates that PET-CT may help in identifying suitable candidates for nonoperative management and predicting pathologic complete response after chemoradiation therapy. In a study involving 125 participants, post-chemoradiation SUVmax <4.3 and %SUVmax decrease of >66% were found to be equally effective at predicting pCR with moderate sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. These findings imply that PET-CT might assist in identifying patients who did not achieve pCR as well as overall survival in those undergoing chemoradiation for rectal cancer. Nonetheless, additional studies are necessary to validate these results.",

The study found that PET scan provided additional information in 55.5% of patients when compared with CT and MRI alone, but only 18.2% of the PET findings resulted in an altered management for the patient. The value of PET in routine preoperative rectal cancer staging remains unclear.",
            "Routine FDG-PET/CT scans can impact clinical management and radiation treatment planning in locally advanced rectal cancer patients by providing prognostic information through metabolic tumor volume measurement, altering planned clinical management, decreasing interobserver variability in contouring target boost volumes, predicting pathologic complete response (pCR), and survival. However, current international guidelines do not recommend routine PET/CT scans; considering its potential value in certain circumstances may be beneficial for patient care.",

Additionally, a study found that 18F-FDG PET/CT is a valid tool that complements the clinical assessment of tumor response after chemoradiation therapy (CRT) completion in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. Therefore, it could be suggested that PET-CT may have a role in the initial evaluation of locally advanced rectal cancer patients, particularly in cases with ambiguous or equivocal lesions on CT, and in assessing treatment response after CRT completion. However, further research is needed to establish the clinical utility and cost-effectiveness of routine PET-CT scans in the initial evaluation of locally advanced rectal cancer patients.",

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for rectal cancer do not include PET-CT as a routine imaging modality for initial staging. The use of PET-CT in this setting is typically reserved for cases where there is concern for distant metastases or for patients with a history of prior pelvic radiation. The use of PET-CT in the initial evaluation of rectal cancer patients should be individualized based on the patient's clinical presentation and the availability of other imaging modalities such as MRI and CT.",
            "According to international guidelines, PET-CT is not routinely recommended for the initial evaluation of locally advanced rectal cancer. However, recent studies have shown that PET-CT can impact clinical management and radiation treatment planning in these patients. A meta-analysis found that post-CRT PET-CT showed a reduction in SUVmax and response index (RI) irrespective of histological findings. Tumors confirmed to have regressed after CRT had a higher mean RI compared with nonresponders, and histopathological responders had a lower post-CRT SUVmax. Therefore, PET-CT may be a useful addition to current imaging modalities in assessing treatment response. However, more research is needed before routine use of PET-CT can be recommended for the initial evaluation of locally advanced rectal cancer patients.",
            "Based on the provided information, routine PET-CT scans may be indicated in the initial evaluation of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. Here's why:\n\n1. PET-CT combines functional and anatomical imaging, allowing precise localization of metabolic activity and identification of cancerous formations regardless of size. This is important for accurate staging.\n\n2. For colorectal cancer, PET-CT is used to determine if metastases are present in the chest, abdomen, and pelvis after initial CT discovery of the cancer. Identifying metastases is crucial for staging and treatment planning.\n\n3. Correct staging is critical to guide appropriate treatment. Clinical staging, which includes information from PET-CT, provides key data to inform treatment decisions before surgery.\n\n4. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy has become standard treatment for locally advanced rectal tumors. PET-CT staging helps identify which patients may benefit from this approach to downsize/downstage tumors before surgery and decrease local recurrence rates.\n\nIn conclusion, given the importance of accurate staging to guide treatment and the ability of PET-CT to precisely identify tumor spread, routine PET-CT scans are likely indicated in the initial evaluation of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. However, MRI also plays a key role in local tumor assessment and monitoring response to neoadjuvant therapy.",

Immunotherapy, specifically neoadjuvant therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), has shown promising results in treating MSI-H/dMMR rectal cancer. ICIs are more active in treatment-na\u00efve patients than in patients with refractory MSI-H/dMMR metastatic colorectal cancer, and they have been shown to be effective in achieving complete clinical and pathological responses in locally advanced MSI-H/dMMR rectal cancer patients. Additionally, neoadjuvant treatment with ICIs has the potential to preserve organ function and fertility in young patients. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider neoadjuvant immunotherapy as a viable alternative to surgical resection for MSI-H locally advanced rectal cancer patients. However, clinical trials are",

Surgical resection following neoadjuvant immunotherapy may be considered as a treatment strategy, especially when there is a good response to immunotherapy leading to tumor downsizing or achieving a pathological complete response (pCR). The decision between surgical resection and immunotherapy should be individualized based on factors such as tumor response to immunotherapy, patient's overall health status, and treatment goals. Further studies and clinical trials are ongoing to determine the optimal treatment approach for MSI-H locally advanced rectal cancer patients.",

            "No, surgical resection may not be the most appropriate treatment for MSI-H locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) patients. Recent studies suggest that neoadjuvant immunotherapy (NAICI) treatment, such as monoimmunotherapy with PD-1 inhibitor, can have favorable overall response rate (ORR) and pathological complete response (pCR) rate, as well as relatively low incidences of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) and serious adverse events (srAEs) for patients with dMMR/MSI-H LARC. Additionally, a case report showed that a patient with LARC and MSI-H achieved pCR and complete radical resection after being treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (TNT) with nivolumab. The NICHE trial also pioneered the use of NAICI treatment in LARC, and recent reports from several phase II studies have demonstrated satisfactory tumor downsizing in CRC. However, further studies are needed to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety of immunotherapy in MSI-H LARC patients.",

However, recent studies have shown that neoadjuvant treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can be highly effective in MSI-H locally advanced rectal cancer patients, resulting in a complete clinical and pathological response. While these results are promising, it is important to note that they come from case reports and small studies, and further research is needed to establish the role of ICIs in the treatment of MSI-H locally advanced rectal cancer. Additionally, organ-preservation strategies should be evaluated in clinical trials. Therefore, while surgical resection remains the standard of care, immunotherapy may be a promising alternative for MSI-H locally advanced rectal cancer patients.",

In fact, ongoing clinical trials are investigating the role of ICIs in combination with neoadjuvant therapy in MSI-H locally advanced rectal cancer patients to determine if they can improve outcomes beyond surgery alone.

This is because these patients typically receive little benefit from neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) or neoadjuvant chemotherapy (nCT), which are common pre-surgical treatments aimed at reducing tumor size and spread. Since MSI-H/dMMR tumors have a unique genetic profile that makes them less responsive to these therapies, focusing on surgical options could be more beneficial.

A retrospective single-center study suggested that the use of bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy in this patient population can result in high disease control rates. However, the selection of patients may have influenced the results, and further research is necessary to confirm these findings. In contrast, clinical data and in vitro studies suggest that a previous anti-VEGF therapy may decrease the efficacy of anti-EGFR therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer. Therefore, it is uncertain whether bevacizumab is indicated after progression to a previous regimen with bevacizumab in advanced colorectal cancer patients, and further research is needed to determine its efficacy in this setting.",

According to the document, adding bevacizumab to second-line regimen after failing a bevacizumab-containing regimen does not indicate any benefit. Instead, it suggests that patients may develop addiction to anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents in these cases.",
            "According to the guidelines by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), the use of Bevacizumab after progression to a previous regimen with Bevacizumab is not recommended in advanced colorectal cancer patients. However, in some clinical trials, Bevacizumab has shown activity in patients who have previously received Bevacizumab, and its use in this setting is being investigated in ongoing clinical trials. Therefore, the decision to continue Bevacizumab in this setting should be made on an individual basis, taking into account the patient's overall clinical condition and the potential risks and benefits of continued treatment. In summary, the answer is both yes and no, depending on the specific context and recommendations from a healthcare provider.",

The study mentioned in the context evaluated the efficacy and adverse events of Bevacizumab in colorectal cancer patients. It showed that the median time to progression (TTP) was not significantly different between combination therapy with mFOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI. However, the TTP of Bevacizumab first-line treatment was significantly longer than that of second-line treatment. Therefore, Bevacizumab is recommended for first-line therapy of advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer, but its use after progression to a previous regimen with Bevacizumab is not supported by the available evidence.",
            "The question posed is whether the use of bevacizumab is indicated after progression to a previous regimen containing bevacizumab in advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. While there are limited data on this specific scenario, clinical practice and expert opinions suggest that for some patients with metastatic CRC who have progressed on a prior bevacizumab-containing regimen, reintroduction of bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy may still provide benefit. This is based on the premise that despite initial progression, these patients may respond differently to subsequent treatments due to factors such as tumor heterogeneity and the potential for different mechanisms of resistance. However, decisions regarding retreatment should take into account individual patient characteristics, including disease status, response to previous therapy, overall health, and treatment goals. It is important to note that further research is needed to better understand the role of bevacizumab in this context and to establish clear guidelines for its use after progression on a prior",

While some studies suggest that continuing bevacizumab therapy can improve survival outcomes in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have progressed on previous treatment, other studies have found inconclusive results regarding the efficacy of bevacizumab in this setting. Additionally, the safety profile of continued bevacizumab use has been shown to be manageable but requires careful monitoring for potential side effects. Ultimately, the decision to use bevacizumab after progression to a previous regimen should be individualized and take into account factors such as patient performance status, tumor burden, and other relevant clinical variables. It is important to consult with a qualified healthcare professional to determine the best course of treatment for each patient.",

Studies have shown that continuing anti-VEGF therapy with bevacizumab in second-line treatment, even after progression on a bevacizumab-containing first-line regimen, can provide survival benefits. Bevacizumab may be added to first, second, and third-line chemotherapy for palliative treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, with data indicating increased patient survival, good response rates, and low toxicity. The benefit of maintaining bevacizumab or switching to other anti-VEGF agents like aflibercept after first-line progression suggests an ongoing dependence on VEGF inhibition in these patients.",

            "The question of whether PDYD polymorphism determination should be routinely performed in patients with colorectal cancer is a complex one. The literature suggests that DPD deficiency, which is caused by genetic variations in the DPYD gene, is a significant risk factor for severe toxicities associated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) therapy. However, the current methods for determining DPD status are not yet suitable for routine clinical practice. While complete genotyping of the DPYD gene would be ideal, it is not currently feasible for routine use. Prospective genotyping for specific polymorphisms, such as the exon 14-skipping and 2846A>T-polymorphisms, may reduce the risk of serious toxic events by about 25%. However, the cost-effectiveness of such screening methods would need to be evaluated before they could be widely implemented in",

This could potentially spare patients from experiencing life-threatening adverse reactions and reduce the need for costly and time-consuming medical interventions. However, others argue that the frequency of DPYD variants is relatively low, and the cost and time required for genetic testing may not be justified for all patients with colorectal cancer.

Additionally, CTC could be a cost-effective option for CRC screening among Medicare enrollees if the reimbursement rate per scan is substantially less than that for colonoscopy or if a large proportion of otherwise unscreened persons were to undergo screening by CTC. However, when taking fecal immunochemical test (FIT) screening as the reference, imaging is not cost-effective.\n\nIn summary, CT colonography can be a cost-effective test for colorectal cancer screening, but the cost-effectiveness may depend on various factors such as the diagnostic accuracy of CTC, the cost of the test, and the proportion of unscreened individuals undergoing CTC.",
            "Yes, CT colonography (CTC) can be a cost-effective test for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening under certain conditions. A CEA would involve comparing the cost of implementing CTC to its health benefits, such as the number of lives saved or the reduction in CRC incidence. The ICER would then provide a measure of the cost-effectiveness of CTC relative to other CRC screening methods.\n\nAccording to various studies, CTC can be cost-effective when the diagnostic accuracy of CTC is high, if costs are about 60% of those of optical colonoscopy, if the reimbursement rate per scan is substantially less than that for colonoscopy, or if a large proportion of otherwise unscreened persons were to undergo screening by CTC. However, CTC needs to achieve a higher attendance rate or cost less than colonoscopy to be cost-effective relative to colonoscopy.\n\nIn summary, CTC can be a cost-effective option for CRC screening, but its cost-effectiveness depends on various factors such as the diagnostic accuracy of CTC, the cost of the test, and the proportion of unscreened individuals who would undergo CTC screening.",
            "Based on the abstracts, CT colonography can be a cost-effective test for colorectal cancer screening under certain conditions. According to one study, CT colonography is an effective and cost-effective screening test relative to no screening, but optical colonoscopy dominates 2-dimensional CT colonography done every 5 or 10 years. Another study found that CT colonography was more cost-effective than colonoscopy in strategies with multiple lifetime screenings. However, the cost-effectiveness of CT colonography depends on factors such as diagnostic accuracy, test costs, and adherence rates. If optical colonoscopy costs are high (e.g., 1.6 times more than CT colonography), or if the sensitivity of CT colonography for 1 cm adenomas is low (\u226483%), then optical colonoscopy may be a dominant strategy. Overall, CT colonography can be a cost-effective complement to traditional colonoscopy if reasonably priced and used with appropriate cut-off levels (>6 mm polyp) to increase its sensitivity.",

            "Yes, CT colonography (CTC) is generally considered a cost-effective test for colorectal cancer screening compared to no screening. However, the cost-effectiveness of CTC relative to other screening methods like colonoscopy depends on various factors:\n\n- CTC is cost-effective compared to no screening under a range of assumptions.\n\n- For CTC to be as cost-effective as colonoscopy screening every 10 years, it needs to be offered every 5 years and the costs must be substantially lower than colonoscopy (around 40-60% of colonoscopy costs). \n\n- CTC could be cost-effective among Medicare enrollees if the reimbursement rate is much less than colonoscopy or if it substantially increases screening rates in those who would otherwise go unscreened.\n\n- When compared to fecal immunochemical testing (FIT), CTC was found to not be cost-effective.\n\nIn summary, CTC is cost-effective compared to no screening, but colonoscopy tends to be more cost-effective in many evaluations. CTC's cost-effectiveness depends on pricing, screening interval, and its ability to improve population screening rates. More recent low-cost CTC technologies may make it more cost-competitive with colonoscopy.",

Subgroup analyses were conducted to assess whether outcomes differed by exercise mode, duration, supervision, and treatment. The review found that there was no difference in adverse event risk between exercise and usual care.

Now, thanks to improved genome-scale mapping of methylation, we can evaluate DNA methylation in different genomic contexts: transcriptional start sites with or without CpG islands, in gene bodies, at regulatory elements, and at repeat sequences. The emerging picture is that the function of DNA methylation seems to vary with context, and the relationship between DNA methylation and transcription is more nuanced than we realized at first. For example, in the standard model, methylation in gene promoters has received the most attention since it is generally associated with transcriptional silencing. In contrast, recent studies in human tissues reveal that methylation of the region downstream of the transcription start site is highly informative of gene expression. Also, in some cell types and specific genes, it has been found that methylation of the first intron is linked with gene expression. Therefore, improving our understanding of the functions of DNA methylation is necessary for interpreting changes in this mark that are observed in diseases such as cancer.",
            "DNA methylation is not always associated with gene silencing. While it is true that DNA methylation is frequently described as a 'silencing' epigenetic mark, recent studies have shown that its function varies with context. Improved genome-scale mapping of methylation has allowed for a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between DNA methylation and transcription. For example, methylation in gene bodies, regulatory elements, and repeat sequences can have positive associations with gene expression. Additionally, recent studies in human tissues have found that methylation downstream of the transcription start site and in the first intron, a gene feature typically rich in enhancers, is linked with gene expression. Therefore, DNA methylation should not be solely considered as a mark of gene silencing, but rather as a more complex mechanism of epigenetic regulation."

A meta-analysis of 41 studies found that fish consumption was associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer. However, a cohort study in the United States found no association between fish intake and colorectal cancer risk.

For example, a case-control study in Eastern Europe found that increased fish intake was associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer, even after adjusting for potential confounders such as demographic characteristics, body mass index, smoking status, and physical activity. Similarly, a prospective cohort study in the United States found that men who consumed fish at least once a week had a lower risk of colorectal cancer than those who rarely or never consumed fish. The protective effect of fish consumption on colorectal cancer risk may be due to the presence of long-chain n-3 fatty acids, which have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects in laboratory and animal studies.

The protective effect may be attributed to the high content of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in some fish.

            "Based on the provided abstracts, short-course radiation therapy (SCRT) appears to be a cost-effective therapy in the neoadjuvant treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer. A cost-effectiveness analysis found that SCRT was the cost-effective strategy compared with long-course chemoradiotherapy, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $133,495 per quality-adjusted life-year. Another study conducted in Peru reported that SCRT-TNT regimens reduced costs by at least 50% compared to conventional chemoradiotherapy. Additionally, a phase 1 study demonstrated the safety and feasibility of neoadjuvant short-course RT concurrent with infusional 5-fluorouracil for locally advanced rectal cancer. Overall, these findings suggest that SCRT is a cost-effective and safe approach for the neoadjuvant treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer.",
            "Short-course radiation therapy (SCRT) is a cost-effective therapy in the neoadjuvant treatment of locally advanced distal rectal cancer, as shown in an analysis comparing it with long-course chemoradiotherapy (LCCRT). The study found that SCRT was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $133,495 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), while LCCRT had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $61,123 per QALY, assuming a greater proportion of patients with locally advanced distal tumors undergoing LCCRT would proceed to a more extensive surgery. SCRT with early surgery offers similar oncologic efficacy for locally advanced rectal cancer patients as compared to long-course chemoradiation with delayed surgery. Moreover, delaying surgery after SCRT decreases post-operative complications and improves tumor downstaging, offering the opportunity to administer neoadjuvant systemic therapy. A study comparing the cost-effectiveness of total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT), which involves complete chemotherapy and chemoradiation before surgery, with the current standard of care for locally advanced rectal cancer found that TNT had a cost-effectiveness of 40,708 $/life-year, compared to 44,248 $/life-year for conventional therapy. Sensitivity analysis showed that TNT would remain the dominant strategy if the completion rate for total neoadjuvant therapy is 90% or higher, and the adjuvant chemotherapy completion rate is less than 93%.",

Additionally, SCRT is associated with higher compliance rates, flexibility in timing, and the ability to add neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy. SCRT is also equivalent to long-course radiation therapy in terms of tumor response and quality of life, and may provide additional benefits such as allowing for a transition to full dose systemic therapy in the neoadjuvant setting, selective organ preservation in complete responders, and providing a more convenient and cost-effective way of delivering pelvic radiation therapy.",

            "Based on the provided abstracts, it appears that topoisomerase I (TOP1) copy number alterations may be associated with response to irinotecan in metastatic colorectal cancer patients. In one study, a borderline significant association was observed between increasing TOP1 copy number and objective response to irinotecan. However, the ratios of TOP1/CEN-20 and TOP1/CEN-2 did not provide additional information for patient stratification. Another study developed an immunohistochemistry-based predictive test, P-topoI-Dx, which demonstrated good sensitivity and specificity in identifying patients who responded to camptothecin-based therapy, including irinotecan. Overall, tumor expression of TOP1 may be a promising biomarker of response to irinotecan in colorectal cancer patients, but further validation is needed.",
            "Tumor expression of topoisomerase I (TOPO-1) may be a potential biomarker of response to irinotecan-based chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). In a study of 98 mCRC patients, high expression of TOPO-1 was found to be positively correlated with better curative effect and longer progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients who underwent irinotecan chemotherapy. However, TOPO-1 expression was not significantly correlated with age, gender, tumor site, tumor grade, or metastatic sites in mCRC patients. Additionally, a separate study examining biomarker-guided treatment for patients with colon cancer found that patients with high ABCG2 expression and low TOP-1 expression had worse recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) when treated with irinotecan-based therapy. These findings suggest that TOPO-1 expression may be a useful biomarker for predicting response to irinotecan-based therapy in mCRC patients.",

In a study, the biopsies of the untreated tumor tissue of responding patients showed a significant higher expression of Top1 compared with nonresponding patients. Another study demonstrated a borderline significant association between a stepwise increase in the TOP1 signal count and objective response. Despite limitations of the study, the positive associations between TOP1 and objective response suggest that further analysis in larger tumor material is warranted. However, it is controversial whether the response to irinotecan could be predicted by the expression level of Top1.",
            "The expression level of topoisomerase-I (Topo I) in colorectal cancer (CRC) tumors has been studied as a potential biomarker for predicting response to irinotecan-based therapy. Preliminary data suggests that higher Topo I expression in untreated tumor tissue may be associated with a better response to irinotecan-based chemoradiation. However, other studies have not found a significant association between Topo I expression and response to irinotecan-based therapy. Therefore, the use of Topo I expression as a biomarker for predicting response to irinotecan in CRC patients is still a topic of ongoing research and not yet established in clinical practice.",
            "Based on the abstracts provided, there is evidence suggesting that tumor expression of Topoisomerase I (TOP1) may be a biomarker of response to irinotecan-based therapy in colorectal cancer patients. In one study, TOP1 expression was significantly higher in responding patients with rectal cancer who received neoadjuvant chemoradiation with irinotecan and capecitabine. Additionally, TOP1 expression decreased significantly during treatment in responders. Another study found a borderline significant association between increasing TOP1 copy number and objective response to irinotecan therapy in breast cancer patients. While the evidence is not yet conclusive, these findings suggest that TOP1 may be a useful biomarker for predicting response to irinotecan-based therapy in certain patient populations.",

Another study showed a borderline significant association between increased Topo I levels and objective response.\n\nHowever, other studies did not find a significant difference in response rates between tumors with high and low Topo I expression. One study concluded that clinical response and prognosis did not differ based on Topo I expression levels.\n\nIn summary, while preliminary data suggests a potential role for Topo I as a predictive biomarker, the evidence is mixed and controversial. Larger, well-designed studies, preferably in a randomized setting, are needed to clarify the utility of Topo I expression in guiding irinotecan treatment decisions in colorectal cancer patients.",

            "Based on the abstract, yes, tumor expression of Topoisomerase I (Topo I) is associated with improved outcome in patients with resected colorectal cancer treated with irinotecan-containing adjuvant chemotherapy. In the multivariate analysis, Topo I expression was found to be associated with a reduced risk of death (HR = 0.61, p = 0.009). Moreover, in the subgroup of patients who received irinotecan-containing chemotherapy, those with Topo I expression had better overall survival (HR = 0.47, p = 0.033). These findings suggest that Topo I tumor expression may be a biomarker for predicting response to irinotecan therapy in colorectal cancer patients. However, as the authors conclude, randomized prospective trials are needed to confirm these results.",
            "Yes, tumor expression of Topoisomerase I (Top1) has been identified as a potential biomarker for response to irinotecan therapy in colorectal cancer patients. Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor that blocks the Top1 enzyme, leading to DNA damage and cell death. The inhibition of Top1 by irinotecan is achieved by trapping a subset of Top1-DNA cleavage complexes, specifically those with a guanine +1 in the DNA sequence. Top1 is a DNA topoisomerase that controls and alters the topologic states of DNA during transcription. It is encoded by the TOP1 gene, which is located on chromosome 20. The enzyme catalyzes the transient breaking and rejoining of a single strand of DNA, allowing the broken strand to rotate around the intact strand and altering the topology of DNA. Irinotecan inactivation of Top1 has been shown to be synthetically lethal in combination with deficiencies in expression of specific DNA repair genes, such as the DNA repair WRN gene and the DNA repair MRE11 gene. This synthetic lethality has been observed in patients with colon cancer, with irinotecan being more strongly beneficial for patients with hypermethylated WRN promoters compared to those with unmethylated WRN promoters. In addition, irinotecan inactivation of Top1 may be synthetically lethal with deficient expression of DNA repair gene ATM, which is frequently hypermethylated in many cancers. A 2016 study showed that low expression of the ATM protein in gastric cancer cells in vitro and in a mouse model caused increased sensitivity to inactivation by irinotecan compared to cells with high expression of ATM. Overall, the evidence suggests that Top1 expression may be a useful biomarker for predicting response to irinotecan therapy in colorectal cancer patients, particularly in those with deficiencies in specific DNA repair genes. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and determine the clinical utility of Top1 expression as a biomarker.",

However, this does not constitute sufficient evidence to recommend the general use of calcium supplements to prevent colorectal cancer. The systematic review found a reduction in the development of recurrent colorectal adenoma (OR 0.74, CI 0.58,0.95) when combining the results from two well-designed trials. Another study found that high dietary calcium intake (>1485mg/day) was associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer, but this association may be modified by genetic variation associated with serum calcium concentrations. Overall, while there is some evidence suggesting a potential benefit, more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between calcium supplementation and colorectal cancer prevention.",
            "Calcium dietary supplementation may potentially reduce the risk of colorectal cancer, as suggested by a study that found an inverse association between postdiagnostic total calcium intake and colorectal cancer-specific mortality. The study compared the highest with the lowest quartile intake of postdiagnostic total calcium and found that the multivariable hazard ratio for colorectal cancer-specific mortality was 0.56 (95% CI, 0.32-0.96; P trend = 0.04). Additionally, postdiagnostic supplemental calcium intake was also inversely associated with colorectal cancer-specific mortality, with a multivariable hazard ratio of 0.67 (95% CI, 0.42-1.06; P trend = 0.047). However, these inverse associations were primarily observed in women, and calcium from diet or dairy sources was associated with lower risk in men. Another study found that higher dietary calcium intake was significantly associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer in women, but not in men. Therefore, calcium dietary supplementation may potentially reduce the risk of colorectal cancer, particularly in women, but more research is needed to confirm these findings.",
            "Yes, calcium dietary supplementation can reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. Studies have shown that higher intake of calcium is associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer. The protective effect of calcium is thought to be due to its ability to bind to bile acids and fatty acids in the colon, reducing their ability to damage the colon lining and promote cancer development. Additionally, calcium may also have a direct effect on colon cells, promoting their normal growth and differentiation. However, it is important to note that the evidence for the protective effect of calcium is not conclusive and more research is needed to confirm these findings.",
            "Yes, calcium dietary supplementation has been shown to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer in several studies. A meta-analysis of 14 prospective cohort studies found that high calcium intake was associated with a 25% reduction in colorectal cancer risk. Additionally, a randomized controlled trial found that 9 months of high-dose wheat bran fiber and calcium carbonate supplementation in participants with a history of recently resected colorectal cancer was associated with a 25% reduction in risk of colorectal cancer. The mechanisms by which calcium may reduce colorectal cancer risk are not fully understood, but may involve the inhibition of colonic hyperproliferation and the promotion of apoptosis in colonic epithelial cells. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and to determine the optimal dosage and duration of calcium supplementation for colorectal cancer prevention.",

A meta-analysis of 10 randomized controlled trials found no significant reduction in colorectal cancer risk with calcium supplementation. Additionally, a randomized controlled trial of calcium supplementation in individuals with a history of colorectal adenomas found no significant reduction in the risk of recurrent adenomas. Therefore, it is not recommended to take calcium supplements specifically for the purpose of reducing colorectal cancer risk.",

A systematic review of two randomized controlled trials found that calcium supplementation reduced the development of recurrent colorectal adenoma (OR 0.74, CI 0.58,0.95). Additionally, a study in mice showed that increased dietary calcium was associated with induced apoptosis in normal distal colonic epithelium, which might contribute to its potential chemopreventive role in colorectal carcinogenesis.

However, other studies have inconsistent results, and it is unclear whether the decrease in labeling index correlates with a decrease in occurrence or recurrence of colonic tumors. Additionally, a recent study found that only high dietary calcium intake (>1485 mg/day) was associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer, but supplementation had no significant effect. Further replication in other studies is needed to confirm these findings.",
            "Based on the evidence from multiple studies, calcium dietary supplementation may reduce the risk of colorectal cancer, but the effect appears to be modest. Several studies found an inverse association between higher calcium intake and colorectal cancer incidence. Calcium, along with vitamin D, may play a protective role through a joint action in colorectal carcinogenesis.\n\nHowever, while the evidence suggests calcium supplementation could be beneficial, the magnitude of risk reduction is not definitive. More research is needed to establish clear recommendations on dosage and to determine the extent of protection provided by calcium supplements alone versus in combination with vitamin D.\n\nIn summary, calcium supplementation shows promise as part of a preventive strategy against colorectal cancer, but should be considered alongside other important lifestyle factors like a balanced diet, regular exercise, and avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption. The benefits of supplementation must be weighed against potential risks on an individual basis. Current evidence supports a modest protective effect, but is not conclusive enough to universally recommend calcium supplements solely for colorectal cancer prevention.",

The first abstract describes a case-control study showing an inverse relationship between dietary calcium intake and colorectal cancer risk in a Korean population with relatively low calcium intake. However, a randomized controlled trial described in the second abstract found no significant difference in colorectal cancer incidence between women who received calcium plus vitamin D supplementation and those who received placebo. A meta-analysis of observational studies in the third abstract suggests that higher consumption of milk/dairy products reduces the risk of colon cancer, and high calcium intake reduces the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), but it does not specifically evaluate calcium supplementation. Therefore, more research is needed to determine whether calcium dietary supplementation can reduce the risk of colorectal cancer.",

The risk reduction associated with calcium was similar for both dietary and supplemental sources. Additionally, calcium consumption was inversely related to colorectal cancer risk in a Korean population, where the national average calcium intake level is lower than in Western countries. Therefore, while calcium dietary supplementation may not reduce the overall risk of colorectal cancer, it could potentially have a protective effect against certain sub-sites of the colon and rectal cancer, and its risk reduction effects may be more pronounced in populations with lower calcium intake levels.",
            "No, daily supplementation of calcium with vitamin D for seven years had no effect on the incidence of colorectal cancer among postmenopausal women.

Some studies suggest that high calcium intake, from both dietary and supplemental sources, may have a protective effect against colorectal cancer, particularly in the distal colon and rectum.

            "The evidence on the association between calcium dietary supplementation and the risk of colorectal cancer is not conclusive. Some studies suggest that calcium may help reduce the risk by binding to bile and fatty acids in the gut, but other studies have not found a significant association. High calcium intake may have a greater protective effect against tumors of the distal colon and rectal cancer compared to proximal colon. However, excessive calcium intake can lead to hypercalcemia, which may cause symptoms such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, muscle weakness, increased urination, dehydration, and metabolic bone disease.

The optimal duration of treatment and dosage required to achieve this effect are still being defined, but longer treatment durations and higher doses may lead to greater protective effects. Additionally, combining aspirin with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may enhance its preventative effects. Factors such as lipid metabolism and liver function can influence the suppressive effect of aspirin on colorectal adenoma recurrence. Overall, aspirin is a promising and inexpensive agent for preventing colorectal adenomas and cancer, particularly when used in combination with other beneficial nutrients.",

            "Yes, treatment with acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is indicated to help prevent colorectal adenomas in certain patients. Several randomized controlled trials have shown that regular aspirin use reduces the risk of recurrent colorectal adenomas in patients with a previous history of these lesions. Meta-analyses suggest aspirin decreases recurrence of any adenoma by approximately 17-20% and advanced adenomas by 28% compared to placebo. The effect is seen with low-dose aspirin (80-160 mg/day) taken for at least 1-4 years. However, the benefits must be balanced against the risks of long-term aspirin use, particularly gastrointestinal bleeding. Aspirin is recommended for adenoma prevention in select higher-risk patients, such as those with a personal history of colorectal neoplasia, but is not currently advised for average-risk individuals. Screening colonoscopy with polyp removal remains the primary approach for preventing progression of adenomas to colorectal cancer.",

The mean number of adenomas was also lower in the aspirin group, and the time to detection of a first adenoma was longer.

However, a retrospective analysis of the randomized CALGB/SWOG 80405 trial found no difference in OS, progression-free survival (PFS), or response to therapy between Black and White patients treated on the clinical trial.

            "Yes, black patients have worse survival rates in colorectal cancer compared to white patients. According to the study, black patients had a lower 5-year survival rate compared to white patients (57.3% vs 66.5%). The study found that differences in insurance coverage and tumor characteristics accounted for approximately half of the disparity in survival rates between black and white patients. Additionally, black patients had lower rates of consultation with surgery, medical oncology, and radiation oncology, and received less treatment with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Adjusting for patient, tumor, and demographic variables marginally reduced the risk of death for black patients, but after adjustment for differences in treatment, the increased risk of death for black patients disappeared. These findings suggest that racial disparities in access to healthcare and treatment contribute to inferior survival outcomes for black patients with colorectal cancer.",
