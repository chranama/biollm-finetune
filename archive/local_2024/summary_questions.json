Among patients with recurrence, rectal cancer was associated with better OS compared to right-sided colon cancer, but worse OS compared to left-sided colon cancer. A cohort study in Fars province, southern Iran, found that patients with right-sided colon tumors had lower overall survival (OS) and cancer-related survival (CRS) at 60 months after diagnosis compared to patients with left-sided colon or rectal tumors.

One possible explanation is that rectal cancer has distinct molecular characteristics and responds differently to biological therapies compared to other colon cancers. Additionally, management of patients with metastatic colon and rectal cancers has historically been similar, with patients often grouped together in clinical trials. However, recent studies have demonstrated that right-sided colon cancers have higher rates of microsatellite instability and aberrant activation of the EGFR pathway, while rectal cancers have higher rates of TOPO1 expression and Her2/neu amplification.

Location: The rectum's confined location in the pelvis makes it harder to surgically remove tumors with adequate margins, increasing the risk of local recurrence.\n\n2. Lymph node involvement: Rectal cancers are more likely to spread to regional lymph nodes due to the rectum's extensive lymphatic drainage, significantly lowering 5-year survival rates. \n\n3. Metastasis: The rectum's venous drainage bypasses the liver and drains into the inferior vena cava, enabling metastasis to the lungs and other organs. Distant metastases are associated with very poor survival.\n\n4. Treatment challenges: The rectum's location limits surgical options and increases complication risks. Radiation therapy, often used for rectal cancer, can increase acute toxicity.\n\n5.

            "Aberrant activation of the forkhead protein FOXA1 is observed in advanced hormone-related cancers, such as ER+ breast cancer. However, the key mediators of high FOXA1 signaling remain elusive. FOXA1 can act as a pioneer factor for estrogen receptor (ER), dictating its binding location and therefore its transcriptional activity. In ER+ breast cancer, FOXA1 plays a pivotal role from early-stage cancer to drug-resistant and metastatic disease. Due to this key role in mediating ER function, FOXA1 is not only an attractive therapeutic target but could potentially function as a novel biomarker.",
            "The FOXA1 transcription factor plays a crucial role in estrogen-receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer. As a pioneer factor, FOXA1 facilitates chromatin binding and function of lineage-specific and oncogenic transcription factors. Upregulation of FOXA1 promotes enhancer and transcriptional reprogramming in endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells, leading to the activation of prometastatic gene sets and pathways associated with poor clinical outcomes. FOXA1 mutations influence therapeutic responses by altering chromatin state, and high FOXA1 expression is associated with worse outcomes to endocrine therapy. Conversely, co-expression of FOXA1 and FOXP1 is linked to a favorable prognosis in tamoxifen-treated breast cancer patients. Overall, FOXA1 modulates estrogen signaling, contributing to the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells, and its aberrant expression or mutations may serve as potential indicators for treatment strategies and clinical outcomes.",
            "The FOXA1 transcription factor plays a crucial role in estrogen-receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer. It is a pioneer factor that facilitates the binding of estrogen receptors (ERs) to DNA, thereby modulating the expression of ER-target genes. This interaction is essential for the growth and survival of ER+ breast cancer cells. FOXA1 also cooperates with other transcription factors, such as GATA3, to maintain the luminal epithelial cell phenotype and inhibit the invasion of cancer cells. Moreover, FOXA1 mutations or altered expression have been associated with endocrine therapy resistance in ER+ breast cancer patients. Overall, FOXA1 is a significant player in ER+ breast cancer development and progression, and understanding its role may provide insights into potential therapeutic strategies.",
            "In estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer, the FOXA1 transcription factor acts as a pioneer factor that facilitates the binding of estrogen receptor alpha (ER\u03b1) to DNA. FOXA1 binds to condensed chromatin and opens it up, allowing ER\u03b1 to access its target genes and regulate their transcription. FOXA1 is essential for the transcriptional activity of ER\u03b1 in ER+ breast cancer cells.\n\nFOXA1 expression is highly correlated with ER\u03b1 positivity and endocrine signaling in breast cancer. High levels of FOXA1 may identify ER+ breast cancers that undergo rapid reprogramming of ER\u03b1 signaling, which is associated with poor outcomes and resistance to endocrine therapies like tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors.\n\nIn summary, FOXA1 plays a key role in ER+ breast cancer by enabling ER\u03b1-mediated transcription and its expression may serve as a biomarker for aggressive disease and endocrine resistance."

However, male breast cancer accounts for less than 1% of all cancers in men and less than 1% of all breast cancers. Despite its rarity, the incidence of male breast cancer has been increasing over the past 25 years. The major risk factors for the development of male breast cancer include advancing age, hormonal imbalance, radiation exposure, and a family history of breast cancer. BRCA2 gene mutations are the most common genetic risk factor for male breast cancer. Male breast cancer is often diagnosed at a later stage than female breast cancer, with higher-grade tumors and lower estrogen receptor positivity.

The TM plays an important role in the formation of the tumor microenvironment, regulation of local immunity, and modification of tumor cell biology, and directly affects the efficacy of drug treatment for tumors. Recent studies have begun to highlight the diverse and tumor-specific microbiomes across multiple cancer types. New evidence suggests that microbes are also present in many tumors, though the scope of how they affect tumor biology and clinical outcomes is in its early stages. In cancer patients, the clinical response to checkpoint-based immunotherapy is associated with the composition and functional quality of the host microbiome. Our study suggests novel microbiome-specific/derived biomarkers for checkpoint immunotherapy response prediction and prognosis in lung cancer.",

The three main clinical variants of BL are endemic, sporadic, and immunodeficiency-associated. The endemic variant is most common in equatorial Africa, where malaria is prevalent, and nearly all cases are EBV-positive. The sporadic variant is more common in North America and Europe, with a male-to-female ratio of 3:1 and approximately 20-30% of cases are EBV-positive. The immunodeficiency-associated variant is often seen in HIV-infected individuals and post-transplant patients, with a male-to-female ratio of 1:1 and a high prevalence of EBV infection (25-40%).\n\nThe primary oncogenic event in BL is the dysregulation of the c-myc gene by one of three chromosomal translocations, which place the myc gene under the control of an immunoglobulin gene enhancer. This translocation is found in 90% of BL cases. Additional mutations, such as TP53, ARF, USP7, and SIN3A mutations, are necessary for lymphoma development.\n\nEBV infection contributes to BL pathogenesis by promoting cellular growth through modification of normal signaling pathways and limiting apoptosis in cells with c-myc translocations. Malaria infection can further contribute to the development of endemic BL by causing genomic instability and promoting B-cell proliferation.\n\nDiagnosis of BL involves the detection of clonal rearrangements of immunoglobulin heavy chain genes and characteristic histopathological features. Treatment typically includes chemotherapy regimens, such as GMALL-B-ALL/NHL2002, modified Magrath, COPADM, hyper-CVAD, and CALGB 8811, which can be associated with rituximab. Prognosis is generally better for children, with a 90% overall cure rate in developed countries. However, outcomes are worse for adults, especially in cases of failed initial treatment or return of the disease.\n\nIn summary, EBV infection is a key factor in the pathogenesis of BL, particularly in the endemic variant, and malaria infection can further contribute to its development. The primary oncogenic event is the dysregulation of the c-myc gene, and additional mutations are necessary for lymphoma development. Diagnosis is based on the detection of clonal rearrangements of immunoglobulin heavy chain genes and characteristic histopathological features, and treatment typically includes chemotherapy regimens.",
            "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is strongly associated with endemic Burkitt lymphoma (BL), especially in Africa. Evidence suggests EBV plays a role in the pathogenesis of endemic BL through several potential mechanisms:\n\n1. EBV may contribute to deregulation of the c-MYC oncogene via chromosomal translocation, a hallmark of BL tumors. \n\n2. Malaria (P. falciparum) infection appears to work together with EBV in endemic BL. Malaria may induce EBV reactivation and expansion of EBV-infected B cells, increasing chances of c-MYC translocation. Malaria may also impair EBV-specific T-cell immunity.\n\n3. Endemic BL shows a lower mutation burden than sporadic BL, suggesting EBV drives an alternative, possibly epigenetic process of transformation in endemic cases.\n\nIn summary, while EBV infection alone is not sufficient to cause endemic BL, evidence indicates it contributes to pathogenesis through interactions with malaria, deregulation of c-MYC, and epigenetic mechanisms. The virus appears necessary but not solely responsible for development of endemic Burkitt lymphoma."

            "High tumor levels of the EGFR ligands amphiregulin (AREG) and epiregulin (EREG) are associated with anti-EGFR agent response in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).  AREG and EREC are biomarkers of response to EGFR inhibitors.",
            "Epiregulin (EREG) and Amphiregulin (AREG) are ligands of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), which is a target for cancer therapy. In colorectal cancer, high expression levels of EREG and AREG have been identified as predictive biomarkers for response to EGFR inhibitors such as cetuximab and panitumumab. Patients with high tumor expression of these ligands tend to have improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) when treated with EGFR inhibitors, compared to those with low expression levels. This suggests that EREG and AREG play a crucial role in the use of EGFR inhibitors for colorectal cancer, as their expression may help identify patients most likely to benefit from these therapies.",
            "Amphiregulin and epiregulin were shown to play critical roles in the response to EGFR inhibitors in colorectal cancer; this role is independent of KRAS mutations. When both epiregulin and amphiregulin expression were detected, the response to EGFR inhibitors increased significantly.",
            "Epiregulin (EREG) and amphiregulin (AREG) are ligands of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and their overexpression may indicate EGFR dependency in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), regardless of tumor sidedness. High AREG/EREG expression is associated with sensitivity to EGFR blockade, particularly in patients with right-sided tumors and a lack of genomic drivers of primary resistance beyond RAS and BRAF mutations. The expression of AREG and EREG is positively correlated with a response to EGFR-targeted therapies in colorectal cancer. Gene-body methylation sites, which show a strong inverse correlation with AREG and EREG gene expression, have been identified in cell lines and human colorectal cancer samples. Treatment of colorectal cancer cells with 5-aza-2'-desoxycytidine, a demethylating agent, results in decreased methylation and increased AREG and EREG gene expression. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) overexpression in colon cancer cells has been shown to upregulate EGFR signaling, secrete EGFR ligands such as AREG, and promote tumor growth. FGFR4 overexpression also reduces cetuximab-induced cytotoxicity, while the combination of an FGFR4 inhibitor and cetuximab has shown profound antitumor effects. Clinically, there is a positive correlation between FGFR4 and AREG expression in tumor tissue, but not in normal tissue, from colon cancer patients. A study was conducted to investigate the effects of baseline plasma AREG levels in KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF wild-type metastatic CRC on treatment outcome with palliative first-line cetuximab + FOLFIRI chemotherapy. The results showed that high baseline plasma AREG levels were significantly associated with inferior progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with cetuximab-based therapy. Additionally, in vitro studies using CRC cell lines sensitive to cetuximab showed that AREG decreased the anti-proliferative effect of cetuximab via AKT and ERK activation. However, after acquiring cetuximab resistance, AREG did not increase colony formation or activate AKT and ERK after cetuximab treatment. These findings suggest that high tumor production of EGFR ligands, including AREG and epiregulin, may predict benefit from anti-EGFR therapy in mCRC.",

IL-17 induces early intestinal inflammation, cancer cell survival, and proliferation, ultimately activating the STAT3 pathway. Additionally, ETBF degrades E-cadherin, altering signaling pathways and upregulating spermine oxidase, leading to carcinogenesis and irreversible DNA damage.

However, a subtype of B. fragilis, known as enterotoxigenic B. fragilis (ETBF), produces an enterotoxin called B. fragilis toxin (BFT) that can lead to asymptomatic chronic infections and colonic tumor formation. ETBF has been associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) through a molecular mechanism involving the activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)3, which is triggered by the interaction between epithelial cells and BFT. This activation of STAT3 leads to an increase in the levels of interleukin (IL)-17 due to the generation of T-helper (Th17) cells and a reduction in the amount of IL-2 due to the activation of regulatory T-cell (Tregs). The enterotoxin BFT has also been shown to trigger the expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, which releases prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and contributes to inflammation and the control of cell proliferation, leading to the development of CRC.",

            "Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) is a key rate-limiting enzyme in the Krebs cycle that plays an important role in energy metabolism. In recent years, it has been found that IDH mutations are closely related to the occurrence and development of glioma, and it is a notable potential therapeutic target. First, IDH mutations can produce high levels of 2-hydroxyglutaric acid (2-HG), thereby inhibiting glioma stem cell differentiation. At the same time, IDH mutations can upregulate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to promote the formation of the tumor microenvironment. In addition, IDH mutations can also induce high levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) to promote glioma invasion. Ultimately, these changes will lead to the development of glioma. Finally, in addition to affecting gliomas directly, mutations in IDH can also alter their immune microenvironment and can change immune-cell function in direct and indirect ways. Currently, a large number of IDH inhibitors and vaccines have entered clinical trials, representing progress in the treatment of glioma patients.",
            "Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations play a crucial role in the development and progression of glioma, a type of brain cancer. IDH mutations are commonly observed in lower-grade gliomas and secondary glioblastomas. These mutations lead to the production of 2-hydroxyglutarate, an oncometabolite that inhibits glioma stem cell differentiation and promotes the formation of the tumor microenvironment. IDH mutations also upregulate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and induce high levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), promoting glioma invasion. Additionally, IDH mutations alter the immune microenvironment and change immune-cell function, making them a potential therapeutic target. IDH mutations are a favorable prognostic factor for human glioma and can be used as a biomarker for differential diagnosis and subclassification. Targeting IDH mutations with inhibitors and vaccines has shown promise in treating glioma patients. Overall, IDH mutations are a key driver of gliomagenesis and a promising target for glioma therapy.",

High-fat, high-protein, low-fiber diets can cause an unfavorable microbial environment in the human colon, predisposing some individuals towards large bowel diseases. The irregular emptying of rapidly fermentable ileal digesta into the colon causes a surge in microbial activity. The sudden availability of rapidly fermentable substrate generates a large microbial population that soon depletes its substrate. For microorganisms to perpetuate, they must induce enzymes to ferment dying or dead microbes (cannibalism) in addition to colonic epithelial mucosa and mucins. As the carbohydrate-to-nitrogen ratio of the colonic contents decreases, the fermentation becomes more proteolytic and subacute levels of fermentation products such as ammonia may be generated. Carcinogens are concentrated within a small colonic mass and the probability of precancerous lesions and polyps developing in the colonic mucosa is directly related to the severity, frequency, and duration of these microbial \"feast or famine\" situations in the colon.\n\nCertain bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, have acquired the ability to induce chronic inflammation and/or produce toxins, such as cyclomodulin, which could participate in the carcinogenesis process.

It represents about 10-20% of all Myasthenia Gravis cases. It is more common in women, and is characterized by the presence of MuSK antibodies, which target a receptor tyrosine kinase in the postsynaptic muscle membrane.

MuSK plays a crucial role in the agrin-signaling pathway and anchors the collagenic tail subunit (ColQ) of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), essential for muscle function.

MuSK antibodies define a form of MG that can be difficult to diagnose, can be life-threatening, and may require additional treatments. MuSK MG patients have reduced B10 cells, a rare regulatory B-cell subset that potently blocks Th1 and Th17 responses, suggesting a potential mechanism for the breakdown in immune tolerance.

MuSK antibodies are found in a variable proportion of AChR antibody negative MG patients, who are often young adult females with bulbar, neck, or respiratory muscle weakness.
